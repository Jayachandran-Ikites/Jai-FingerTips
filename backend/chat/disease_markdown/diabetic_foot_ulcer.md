**Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) Pathway**
#L2
Approximately 18.6 million people worldwide are affected by a diabetic foot ulcer each year.
#L3
These ulcers precede 80% of lower extremity amputations among people diagnosed with
#L4
diabetes and are associated with an increased risk of death. Approximately [50% of ulcers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35063288/) become
#L5
infected, with up to 20% of these requiring hospitalization; between 15% and 20% of moderate
#L6
to severe infections eventually lead to a lower-extremity amputation. People with a diabetic foot
#L7
ulcer have a [5-year mortality rate of 30%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26248037/), with a mortality rate greater than 70% for people with
#L8
an above-foot amputation.
#L9
According to the International Diabetes Federation, India had an estimated 77 million adults
#L11
living with diabetes in 2019, and this number is expected to rise to 101 million by 2030. Up to
#L12
approximately [34% of people with type 1 or 2 diabetes develop a foot ulcer during their lifetime.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28614678/)
#L13
This incidence is similar when reviewing the limited published data from India.
#L14
Why do ulcers develop?

#I1
the process of diabetic foot ulceration in two sections, "A Pathways to diabetic foot ulcer development" and "B Development of a typical diabetic foot ulcer from mechanical stress." The process begins with a "Patient with diabetes" who may have one of four conditions: "Peripheral sensory neuropathy," characterized by decreased pain, pressure, and temperature sensation and impaired proprioception; "Peripheral motor neuropathy," characterized by small muscle wasting, foot deformities, and biomechanical abnormalities; "Autonomic neuropathy," which involves sympathetic autonomic dysfunction such as decreased sweating and dry skin resulting in less protection from injury; and "Peripheral artery disease," causing decreased lower extremity perfusion and chronic limb-threatening ischemia. The three types of neuropathy lead to "Mechanical pathways" of injury, while peripheral artery disease leads to a "Vascular pathway" resulting in "Necrosis." The mechanical pathways are comprised of "Continuous stress," which is constant low pressure damage leading to ischemic necrosis from sources like ill-fitting shoes; "Repetitive stress" from moderately increased abnormal pressure during weight bearing, which leads to "Callus formation"; and "High stress" from direct mechanical trauma, such as a foreign body in a shoe. All these factors contribute to the final outcome of "Foot ulcer development." Part B illustrates the development of a typical diabetic foot ulcer from mechanical stress in three steps, each with a "Cross section view." Step 1 shows that abnormal pressures on the foot that are not felt during weight bearing due to lack of sensation can lead to superficial callus formation, with the cross-section showing the "Callus" over "SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE," "MUSCLE," and "BONE." Step 2 demonstrates how inflammation and/or minor trauma from impact can induce "Hemorrhage" beneath the callus. Step 3 explains that callus removal reveals an "Ulcer" extending through the epidermis and dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, with a final note stating that "Diabetic foot ulcers sometimes extend deeper into muscle and bone."

#L15
**Screening for DFU**

#L16
Individuals with diabetes are assessed for loss of protective sensation as a sign of large fiber
#L17
neuropathy.
#L18
1. The Semmes-Weinstein 5.07 [monofilament test](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37243927/) to assess for absence of pressure
#L19
   sensation at a minimum of 3 sites per foot (likelihood ratio for ulceration range, 11-16)
#L20
   OR
#L21
2. the 128-Hz tuning fork to assess for absence of [vibratory perception](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37243927/) (using an on-off
#L22
   technique or timed methods; likelihood ratio range, 16-35) are important components of
#L23
   this assessment.
#L24
3. In the absence of this equipment, the [Ipswich Touch Test](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37243927/) is an acceptable alternative that
#L25
   can be used to evaluate whether a [patient can perceive light touch](https://diabeticfootonline.com/2012/04/01/the-ipswich-touch-test-iptt-your-diagnostic-tool-is-at-hand/) from an examiner’s
#L26
   index finger applied to 6 or 8 prespecified sites on the feet (likelihood ratio range, 10-15)
#L27
**Physical exam in patients with DFU**
#L28
*General*
#L29
[Physical examination](https://diabeticfootonline.com/2009/08/04/comprehensive-diabetic-foot-examination-cdfe-video-and-text/) should include evaluation for calluses, interdigital maceration, and
#L30
thickened nails, which may indicate a fungal infection and may be associated with increased
#L31
pressure on the nail bed.
#L32
Digital deformities such as hammer toes or claw toes appear as increased prominence of the
#L33
interphalangeal joints dorsally and the metatarsal heads on the plantar surface and are common
#L34
sites of ulceration. The tip of a toe exposed to increased pressure in contact with the ground or
#L35
shoe is also a common site of ulceration. Assessment of dorsiflexion and plantarflexion ankle
#L36
range of motion can identify equinus deformity (ie, less than 0 degrees of dorsiflexion at the
#L37
ankle joint), which increases forefoot plantar pressure. [In a prospective study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12381796/) of 1666 people
#L38
with diabetes, equinus deformity was present in 10.3% . [Charcot arthropathy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37218537/), defined as a foot
#L39
fracture with possible joint dislocation in people with peripheral neuropathy, affects
#L40
approximately 0.3% of people with diabetes, can lead to significant deformity, and increases the
#L41
risk of a diabetic foot ulcer, particularly in the midfoot and ankle/hindfoot. Although
#L42
approximately 40% of people with Charcot arthropathy have concomitant tissue loss, a unilateral
#L43
red, hot, swollen foot without a wound or diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis may indicate
#L44
Charcot arthropathy.
#L45
Pulse palpation at the ankle and on the foot is a central part of the vascular examination, but
#L46
palpable pulses have [low sensitivity (71.7%) and specificity (72.3%)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26947795/) for detecting peripheral
#L47
artery disease. Because peripheral artery disease affects approximately half of people with
#L48
diabetic foot ulcers, clinicians should consider noninvasive testing with the ankle-brachial index.
#L49
*Ulcer assessment*
#L50
The Wound, Ischemia, Foot Infection (WIfI) classification system was developed and validated
#L51
as a method to combine all 3 variables (wound, ischemia, and foot infection) and to accurately
#L52
assess the risk of limb loss for patients with diabetic foot ulcers.
#L53
**Wound:** Degree of tissue loss, class 1- small/shallow; class 2 exposed bone/joint/tendon; class 3
#L54
extensive deep wound may/may not involve the calcaneum
#L55
**Infection:** The diagnosis of diabetic foot infection is primarily based on clinical assessment and
#L56
is suggested by presence of more than 2 signs of inflammation, such as erythema, swelling and
#L57
possibly purulence, fluctuance, or lymphangitis.
#L58
DO NOT OBTAIN WOUND CULTURES: Randomized clinical trial data are not available to
#L59
support obtaining wound cultures from all patients with diabetic foot ulcers
#L60
An [erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 70 mm/h can be helpful in improving diagnostic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18285592/)
#L61
[accuracy for osteomyelitis (likelihood ratio, 11)](about:blank)
#L62
Particularly among hospitalized patients, for whom the pretest probability of osteomyelitis is
#L63
high, the combination of a positive probe-to-bone test and plain film radiography can be
#L64
sufficient to diagnose osteomyelitis (likelihood ratio, 14) [without the need for other, more](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32729421/)
#L65
[expensive radiological studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32729421/)
#L66
**Ischemia:** 1. [Palpation of anterior tibial and posterior tibial pulses (35% sensitive, 100% specific-](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26342129/)
#L67
for wound healing
#L68
2. Lower extremity peripheral artery disease can be assessed noninvasively with the ankle-
#L69
brachial index. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90 is approximately 98% specific and
#L70
approximately 85% sensitive for peripheral artery disease. Limitations of ABI- people with
#L71
diabetes often have medial calcinosis of lower extremity peripheral vessels, resulting in falsely
#L72
elevated peripheral pressures and a high ankle-brachial index that is insensitive to presence of
#L73
peripheral artery disease. (RESOURCE LIMITATIONS) In these individuals, the toe-brachial
#L74
index can be measured, since the digital arteries are less commonly affected by medial
#L75
calcinosis.35 A toe-brachial index less than 0.70 is consistent with peripheral artery disease.33
#L76
Toe pressure of 30 mm Hg or greater, transcutaneous oxygen pressure of 25 mm Hg or greater,
#L77
and skin perfusion pressure of 40 mm Hg or greater have been associated with higher rates of
#L78
ulcer healing. [The sensitivity and specificity of transcutaneous oxygen pressure for ulcer healing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804365/)
#L79
[were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.61-0.81) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68-0.95), respectively, with a diagnostic OR](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804365/)
#L80
[of 15.81 (95% CI, 3.36-74.45). This is compared with a relatively low progno accuracy for ulcer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804365/)
#L81
[healing using the ankle-brachial index (with cutoffs of <0.9 and ≥1.3), with a sensitivity of 0.48](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804365/)
#L82
[(95% CI, 0.36-0.61), a specificity of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.42-0.63), and a diagnostic OR of 1.02 (95%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804365/)
#L83
[CI, 0.40-2.64).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26804365/)
#L84
A [higher score on the WIfI scale](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230866/) is associated with lower extremity amputation and morbidity
#L85
and can be used to determine the need for revascularization. WIfI scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 were
#L86
associated with 1-year amputation rates of 0%, 8%, 11%, and 38%, respectively

#I2
The Wound, Ischemia, and Foot Infection (WIfI) classification system consists of 3 components graded separately from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where one component may be dominant but the specific combination of scores is used to estimate the risk of limb amputation at 1 year and the need for or benefit of revascularization.ª The first component, Wound (W), is graded based on Ulcer and Gangrene criteria: Grade 0 is None for both Ulcer and Gangrene; Grade 1 is a Small, shallow Ulcer with None for Gangrene; Grade 2 is a Deep Ulcer with exposed bone, joint, or tendon, with Gangrene that is Limited to digits; and Grade 3 is an Extensive, deep, and involving forefoot and/or midfoot with or without calcaneal involvement for Ulcer, with Gangrene that is Extensive and involving forefoot and/or midfoot with Full thickness heel necrosis with or without calcaneal involvement. The second component, Ischemia (I), is graded by Ankle-brachial index/Ankle systolic pressure and Toe pressure or transcutaneous oximetry: Grade 0 is ≥0.80 or >100 mm Hg and ≥60 mm Hg, respectively; Grade 1 is 0.60-0.79 or 70-100 mm Hg and 40-59 mm Hg; Grade 2 is 0.40-0.59 or 50-69 mm Hg and 30-39 mm Hg; and Grade 3 is ≤0.39 or <50 mm Hg and <30 mm Hg. Finally, the third component, Foot Infection (fI), is graded by its Clinical manifestation: Grade 0 has No symptoms or signs of infection; Grade 1 is an Infection indicated by ≥2 of the following: Local swelling or induration, Erythema 0.5-2.0 cm around ulcer, Local tenderness or pain, Local warmth, or Purulent discharge (thick, opaque to white, or sanguineous); Grade 2 is an Infection as described above with Erythema >2 cm around the ulcer, Involving structures deeper than skin and subcutaneous tissues (eg, abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, fasciitis), and No signs of systemic inflammatory response (see below); and Grade 3 is an Infection as described above with ≥2 signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, including Temperature >38 °C or <36 °C, Heart rate >90/min, Respiratory rate >20/min or PaCO₂ <32 mm Hg, or a White blood cell count >12 000/µL or <4000/µL or 10% immature forms.

#L87
**Management**
#L88
3 pillars
#L89
1. Debridement
#L90
2. Off loading
#L91
3. Wound dressings
#L92
**Debridement:** Debridement is a standardized approach used to facilitate healing.52 Healing is
#L93
achieved by eliminating nonviable wound bed and wound edge tissue, including excess callus on
#L94
the periphery and nonviable dermal tissue, as well as foreign materials and bacterial components.
#L95
Although guidelines recommend regular debridement, defined as weekly or every other week,
#L96
randomized clinical trials are lacking
#L97
**Off loading:** The most effective treatment for off-loading a plantar foot ulcer is a knee-high
#L98
nonremovable off-loading device, either a total contact cast or a knee-high walker rendered
#L99
nonremovable. Two national surveys of clinicians in the United States and Australia show that
#L100
the total contact cast was used in only 2% and 15% of patients, respectively, as a primary means
#L101
of off-loading. Clinicians frequently cited patient preference as a reason for lack of total contact 
#L102
cast use

|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Knee-high nonremovable off-loading device[^51] | Total contact cast or knee-high walker rendered nonremovable | Reduces pressure at the ulcer by 80%-90% compared with a standard shoe[^55]; promotes better healing compared with removable devices (relative risk, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.09–1.41 [absolute rates not provided]). First-choice off-loading treatment in international guidelines.[^51] |
| Removable knee-high and ankle-high walkers[^51] | Off-loading devices that can be removed by the patient | Reduces pressure effectively but does not promote healing as well as nonremovable walkers or total contact cast. Second-choice off-loading treatment in international guidelines.[^51] A study of 20 patients wearing waist-mounted activity monitor and device-mounted monitor reported patients engaged in only 28% of their total daily activity while wearing the protective boot compared with when it was not worn (345 [SD, 219] min vs 874 [SD, 828] min; *P* = .01).[^59] |

#L103
Dressings: Few data are available regarding the optimal wound dressing for diabetic foot
#L104 
ulcers.The selection of a wound dressing for a diabetic foot ulcer should be based on wound
#L105 
characteristics, ie, location, presence and/or degree of inflammation, and amount of exudate The
#L106 
dressing should promote a moist environment conducive to tissue growth and epithelial
#L107 
migration without causing excess maceration. It is important to select dressings that remove
#L108 
excess fluid to prevent further tissue inflammation and damage from prolonged contact with the
#L109 
wound or its periphery. In general, hydrogels are preferred for wounds that produce little
#L110 
exudative drainage, while alginates or hydrofibers are recommended for heavily draining wounds

#T2
| **Dressing type**           | **Characteristics and use**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Alginates**              | These dressings form a damp gel on absorption, necessitating a secondary dressing. They are conformable, filling dead spaces and managing moderate to heavy exudate effectively. Suitable for wounds with light to moderate serous drainage.                                                                             |
| **Antimicrobial dressings**| These dressings contain substances such as silver or iodine that inhibit bacterial growth in the wound, making them suitable for infected wounds or those at high risk of infection. However, it is important to note that, as with each of these categories, there is a lack of strong evidence recommending their use. |
| **Collagens**              | Derived from bovine, equine, porcine, or ovine (sheep) sources, these products help stimulate wound healing. Available in various forms such as gel, pad, paste, powder, and sheets. Some dissolve entirely while others need removal per the manufacturer’s guidelines. Ideal for wounds showing granulation tissue.      |
| **Film dressings**         | Thin, transparent dressings that foster a moist environment, promoting healing and enabling wound assessment without removal. Ideal for superficial wounds with minimal exudate.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Foams**                  | These dressings are capable of absorbing moderate quantities of exudate and can be used under compression.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Gauze**                  | Highly permeable dressing material, suitable for wound cleaning, as a cover dressing, and for securing dressings. Gauze is not generally recommended as a primary wound dressing because it can remove healthy granulation tissue during dressing changes.                                                                |
| **Hydrocolloids**          | These bacteria-proof dressings facilitate autolytic debridement. They are not appropriate for infected wounds as they may damage fragile skin. Ideal for wounds with insignificant serous drainage.                                                                                                                        |
| **Hydrogels**              | These are glycerin and water-based products available as amorphous gels, sheets, or impregnated dressings. They can be antimicrobial, donate moisture to wounds, assist in autolytic debridement, and possibly reduce pain. They require a secondary dressing and are suitable for low-exudate wounds needing moisture.  |

revascularization with shorter time to healing among those who received a referral for
#L123

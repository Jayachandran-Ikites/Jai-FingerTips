### Introduction

Approximately 18.6 million people worldwide are affected by a diabetic foot ulcer each year. These ulcers precede 80% of lower extremity amputations among people diagnosed with diabetes and are associated with an increased risk of death. Approximately 50% of ulcers become infected, with up to 20% of these requiring hospitalization; between 15% and 20% of moderate to severe infections eventually lead to a lower-extremity amputation.  People with a diabetic foot ulcer have a 5-year mortality rate of 30%, with a mortality rate greater than 70% for people with an above-foot amputation.
 According to the International Diabetes Federation, India had an estimated 77 million adults living with diabetes in 2019, and this number is expected to rise to 101 million by 2030. Up to approximately 34% of people with type 1 or 2 diabetes develop a foot ulcer during their lifetime. This incidence is similar when reviewing the limited published data from India.

### Why do ulcers develop?

Diabetic foot ulcers develop through several pathways associated with diabetes, primarily influenced by various forms of neuropathy and circulatory issues. Peripheral sensory neuropathy leads to decreased pain, pressure, and temperature sensation, impairing proprioception. This can result in mechanical pathways such as continuous stress from constant low pressure damage, often due to ill-fitting shoes. Furthermore, peripheral artery disease contributes to lower extremity perfusion and ischemia, compounding the risk of ulcer formation.
The development of a typical diabetic foot ulcer can stem from abnormal pressures that go unnoticed during weight-bearing activities, causing callus formation. Minor trauma or inflammation may reveal an ulcer that penetrates deeper into the skin, affecting subcutaneous tissues. Factors like direct mechanical trauma and vascular pathways also play a significant role, potentially leading to necrosis and more severe complications such as ulcers extending into muscle and bone.

### Screening for Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) Risk

Screening for diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) involves evaluating patients with diabetes for signs of large fiber neuropathy, particularly the loss of protective sensation. One of the primary tools for this assessment is the Semmes-Weinstein 5.07 monofilament test, which checks for the absence of pressure sensation at a minimum of three sites on each foot. This method has a high predictive value for ulceration, with a likelihood ratio ranging between 11 and 16. An alternative or complementary method is the use of a 128-Hz tuning fork to assess vibratory perception, applied using either an on-off technique or timed methods. This approach is highly effective, with a likelihood ratio of 16 to 35 for predicting ulceration.
 In resource-limited settings where specialized equipment may not be available, the Ipswich Touch Test serves as a reliable alternative. This test involves using the examiner's index finger to lightly touch six to eight specified points on the patient’s feet to determine if light touch can be perceived. Despite its simplicity, the Ipswich Touch Test still offers a strong predictive value, with a likelihood ratio between 10 and 15, making it a practical tool for early identification of patients at risk for DFU.

### Physical exam in patients with DFU

Physical examination should include evaluation for calluses, interdigital maceration, and thickened nails, which may indicate a fungal infection and may be associated with increased pressure on the nail bed. 
 Digital deformities such as hammer toes or claw toes appear as increased prominence of the interphalangeal joints dorsally and the metatarsal heads on the plantar surface and are common sites of ulceration. The tip of a toe exposed to increased pressure in contact with the ground or shoe is also a common site of ulceration. Assessment of dorsiflexion and plantarflexion ankle range of motion can identify equinus deformity (ie, less than 0 degrees of dorsiflexion at the ankle joint), which increases forefoot plantar pressure. In a prospective study of 1666 people with diabetes, equinus deformity was present in 10.3% . Charcot arthropathy, defined as a foot fracture with possible joint dislocation in people with peripheral neuropathy, affects approximately 0.3% of people with diabetes, can lead to significant deformity, and increases the risk of a diabetic foot ulcer, particularly in the midfoot and ankle/hindfoot. Although approximately 40% of people with Charcot arthropathy have concomitant tissue loss, a unilateral red, hot, swollen foot without a wound or diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis may indicate Charcot arthropathy.
 Pulse palpation at the ankle and on the foot is a central part of the vascular examination, but palpable pulses have low sensitivity (71.7%) and specificity (72.3%) for detecting peripheral artery disease.  Because peripheral artery disease affects approximately half of people with diabetic foot ulcers, clinicians should consider noninvasive testing with the ankle-brachial index.

### Comprehensive Ulcer Assessment Using the WIfI Classification System

The Wound, Ischemia, Foot Infection (WIfI) classification system provides a structured and validated approach for assessing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by combining three critical factors—wound severity, ischemia, and infection. This system is instrumental in evaluating the risk of limb loss. The Wound component categorizes ulcers into three classes: Class 1 includes small and shallow wounds; Class 2 involves exposure of deeper structures such as bone, joint, or tendon; and Class 3 refers to extensive deep wounds that may or may not involve the calcaneum. 
 The Infection component of the WIfI system relies on clinical diagnosis. A diabetic foot infection is suggested when more than two signs of inflammation are present—commonly erythema, swelling, purulence, fluctuance, or lymphangitis. Importantly, routine wound cultures are not recommended, as current evidence from randomized clinical trials does not support their use in all DFU patients. In assessing the risk of osteomyelitis, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (above 70 mm/h) serves as a strong diagnostic indicator with a likelihood ratio of 11. Among hospitalized patients with a high pretest probability, the combination of a positive probe-to-bone test and plain radiography is often sufficient to confirm osteomyelitis (likelihood ratio, 14), reducing the need for advanced imaging. This comprehensive assessment guides effective and targeted management of diabetic foot ulcers.

### Assessing Ischemia in Diabetic Foot Ulcers

Ischemia, a key component of the WIfI classification system, plays a critical role in determining the healing potential and risk of limb loss in diabetic foot ulcers. The initial bedside assessment involves palpating the anterior tibial and posterior tibial pulses, which, though only 35% sensitive, are 100% specific for predicting wound healing. 
  Lower extremity peripheral artery disease can be assessed noninvasively with the anklebrachial index. An ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90 is approximately 98% specific and approximately 85% sensitive for peripheral artery disease. Limitations of ABI- people with diabetes often have medial calcinosis of lower extremity peripheral vessels, resulting in falsely elevated peripheral pressures and a high ankle-brachial index that is insensitive to presence of peripheral artery disease. (RESOURCE LIMITATIONS) In these individuals, the toe-brachial index can be measured, since the digital arteries are less commonly affected by medial calcinosis.35 A toe-brachial index less than 0.70 is consistent with peripheral artery disease.33 Toe pressure of 30 mm Hg or greater, transcutaneous oxygen pressure of 25 mm Hg or greater, and skin perfusion pressure of 40 mm Hg or greater have been associated with higher rates of ulcer healing. The sensitivity and specificity of transcutaneous oxygen pressure for ulcer healing were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.61-0.81) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68-0.95), respectively, with a diagnostic OR of 15.81 (95% CI, 3.36-74.45). This is compared with a relatively low progno accuracy for ulcer healing using the ankle-brachial index (with cutoffs of <0.9 and ≥1.3), with a sensitivity of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.36-0.61), a specificity of 0.52 (95% CI, 0.42-0.63), and a diagnostic OR of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.40-2.64). 
 A higher score on the WIfI scale is associated with lower extremity amputation and morbidity and can be used to determine the need for revascularization. WIfI scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4 were associated with 1-year amputation rates of 0%, 8%, 11%, and 38%, respectively

### Wound, Ischemia, and Foot Infection (WIfI) Classification System

The WIfI classification system evaluates three components: Wound (W), Ischemia (I), and Foot Infection (fl) separately rated from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The dominant component is used to assess the risk of limb amputation within one year and the necessity for revascularization. In the Wound category, grades are defined as follows: Grade 0 has no ulcer or gangrene; Grade 1 has a small, shallow ulcer but no gangrene; Grade 2 shows deep ulcers with exposed bone or tendon, with limited gangrene; and Grade 3 involves extensive ulcers impacting the forefoot or midfoot and may include full thickness necrosis.
In the Ischemia component, grades are determined by the ankle-brachial index and systolic pressure, ranging from Grade 0 (≥0.80) to Grade 3 (≤0.39). The Foot Infection category measures clinical manifestations, specifying symptoms from no signs (Grade 0) to severe systemic manifestations (Grade 3), which include symptoms such as temperature variations, heart rates, and white blood cell counts. Accurate grading is essential for effective medical intervention and management.

### The Wound, Ischemia, and Foot Infection (WIfI) classification

The Wound, Ischemia, and Foot Infection (WIfI) classification system assesses the risk of limb amputation at one year and the need for revascularization. It includes three components graded separately from 0 (none) to 3 (severe): Wound (W), Ischemia (I), and Foot Infection (fI). For the Wound component, Grade 0 indicates no ulcer or gangrene, Grade 1 represents a small, shallow ulcer with no gangrene, Grade 2 corresponds to a deep ulcer with exposed bone, joint, or tendon or gangrene limited to the digits, and Grade 3 describes an extensive, deep ulcer involving the forefoot and/or midfoot with or without calcaneal involvement, or extensive gangrene involving the forefoot and/or midfoot with full-thickness heel necrosis with or without calcaneal involvement. For the Ischemia component, Grade 0 is defined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) >= 0.80 or ankle systolic pressure >100 mmHg, or toe pressure or transcutaneous oximetry >= 60 mmHg. Grade 1 includes an ABI of 0.60–0.79 or ankle systolic pressure of 70–100 mmHg, or toe pressure or transcutaneous oximetry of 40–59 mmHg. Grade 2 includes an ABI of 0.40–0.59 or ankle systolic pressure of 50–69 mmHg, or toe pressure or transcutaneous oximetry of 30–39 mmHg. Grade 3 includes an ABI <= 0.39 or ankle systolic pressure <50 mmHg, or toe pressure or transcutaneous oximetry <30 mmHg. For Foot Infection, Grade 0 means there are no signs or symptoms of infection. Grade 1 indicates infection with >= 2 local signs such as swelling or induration, erythema 0.5–2.0 cm around the ulcer, local tenderness or pain, local warmth, or purulent discharge. Grade 2 includes the same signs but with erythema >2 cm around the ulcer and deeper tissue involvement (e.g., abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or fasciitis), without systemic signs. Grade 3 includes infection with >= 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria: temperature >38 °C or <36 °C, heart rate >90/min, respiratory rate >20/min or PaCO₂ <32 mmHg, or white blood cell count >12,000/µL or <4000/µL or >=10% immature forms.

### Three pillars of management

Three pillars of management are Debridement ,Off loading ,Wound dressings 
 Debridement is a standardized approach used to facilitate healing.52 Healing is achieved by eliminating nonviable wound bed and wound edge tissue, including excess callus on the periphery and nonviable dermal tissue, as well as foreign materials and bacterial components. Although guidelines recommend regular debridement, defined as weekly or every other week, randomized clinical trials are lacking 
 The most effective treatment for off-loading a plantar foot ulcer is a knee-high nonremovable off-loading device, either a total contact cast or a knee-high walker rendered nonremovable. Two national surveys of clinicians in the United States and Australia show that the total contact cast was used in only 2% and 15% of patients, respectively, as a primary means of off-loading. Clinicians frequently cited patient preference as a reason for lack of total contact cast use 
  Few data are available regarding the optimal wound dressing for diabetic foot ulcers.The selection of a wound dressing for a diabetic foot ulcer should be based on wound characteristics, ie, location, presence and/or degree of inflammation, and amount of exudate The dressing should promote a moist environment conducive to tissue growth and epithelial migration without causing excess maceration. It is important to select dressings that remove excess fluid to prevent further tissue inflammation and damage from prolonged contact with the wound or its periphery. In general, hydrogels are preferred for wounds that produce little exudative drainage, while alginates or hydrofibers are recommended for heavily draining wounds

### Off-Loading Methods

The first method described is the knee-high nonremovable off-loading device, which involves a total contact cast or a knee-high walker rendered nonremovable. The outcome or benefit of this method is that it reduces pressure at the ulcer by 80%-90% compared with a standard shoe and promotes better healing compared with removable devices, making it the first-choice off-loading treatment in international guidelines. The second method is removable knee-high and ankle-high walkers, which are off-loading devices that can be removed by the patient. While these effectively reduce pressure, they do not promote healing as well as nonremovable walkers or total contact casts, positioning them as a second-choice off-loading treatment. A study mentioned found that patients wearing a waist-mounted activity monitor and device-mounted monitor reported engaging in only 28% of their total daily activity while wearing the protective boot compared to when it was not worn.

### Wound Healing Dressing Types for Diabetic Foot Ulcers

The table, titled Wound Healing Dressing Types for Diabetic Foot Ulcers, outlines various dressing types along with their characteristics and use. Alginates are described as dressings that form a damp gel on absorption, requiring a secondary dressing, and are conformable, filling dead spaces and managing moderate to heavy exudate effectively, making them suitable for wounds with light to moderate serous drainage. Antimicrobial dressings contain substances like silver or iodine to inhibit bacterial growth, making them suitable for infected wounds or those at high risk of infection, although the text notes a lack of strong evidence recommending their use despite widespread application. Collagen dressings, derived from bovine, equine, porcine, or ovine sources, help stimulate wound healing and are available in various forms; they dissolve entirely while others need removal, and a secondary dressing is usually required, making them ideal for wounds showing granulation tissue as they further stimulate its formation. Film dressings are thin, transparent dressings that foster a moist environment, promoting healing and enabling wound assessment without removal, and are ideal for superficial wounds with minimal exudate. Foams are capable of absorbing moderate quantities of exudate and can be used under compression. Gauze is a highly permeable dressing material, suitable for wound cleaning, as a cover dressing, and for securing dressings, but is generally not recommended as a primary wound dressing because it can remove healthy granulation tissue during dressing changes. Hydrocolloids are bacteria-proof dressings that facilitate autolytic debridement, are not appropriate for infected wounds as they may damage fragile skin, and are ideal for wounds with insignificant serous drainage. Finally, hydrogels are glycerin and water-based products available as amorphous gels, sheets, or impregnated dressings; they can be antimicrobial, donate moisture to wounds, assist in autolytic debridement, and possibly reduce pain, requiring a secondary dressing and are suitable for low-exudate wounds needing additional moisture.

### Management of Infected Diabetic Foot Ulcers and Peripheral Arterial Disease

The treatment of infected diabetic foot ulcers depends on the presence or absence of osteomyelitis. When osteomyelitis is present, treatment should follow the antibiotic pathways outlined in AvoMD. Similarly, if osteomyelitis is absent, the AvoMD antibiotic pathways should still be consulted for appropriate management. While many infections in diabetic foot ulcers are superficial and may respond to medical therapy, some cases necessitate surgical intervention to remove infection in deeper soft tissues. However, in cases of forefoot osteomyelitis without acute soft tissue infection, antibiotic therapy may be as effective as surgical intervention.
 For the treatment of peripheral arterial disease in the context of diabetic foot ulcers, certain interventions should be avoided. Specifically, pentoxifylline and vasodilator drugs are not recommended. In patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia who require revascularization to facilitate tissue healing, delayed intervention is associated with slower healing. A prospective study involving 478 patients showed a significantly improved rate of wound healing among those referred for revascularization within 56 days compared to those referred later (hazard ratio [HR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.52–2.52; P < .001). Therefore, timely revascularization should be prioritized. Revascularization is generally recommended for most patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia; however, the decision should also take into account factors such as treatment cost, patient age, medical comorbidities, functional status, and life expectancy, all of which may influence whether revascularization will meaningfully improve clinical outcomes.

# Disease Name : Symptoms

### symptoms of Asthma

Asthma is defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by three primary pathophysiological changes: swelling inside the airways, excess mucus clogging the airways, and muscle tightening around the airways. These structural and functional alterations result in narrowed airways that impede normal airflow, creating the characteristic symptom profile associated with asthma episodes. The common signs and symptoms of asthma include shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness or pain, wheeze (a whistling sound when breathing), and waking at night due to asthma symptoms. Additional indicators may include a drop in peak flow meter readings for patients who use these monitoring devices. The presentation can vary significantly among individuals, with some patients experiencing only one symptom while others manifest multiple concurrent symptoms. Asthma symptoms can occur at any time and may range from mild episodes lasting only minutes to more severe manifestations persisting for hours or days. The breathing difficulty experienced during an asthma episode has been described as similar to trying to breathe through a straw stuffed with cotton, illustrating the significant respiratory compromise that characterizes this condition. Early recognition of symptoms is crucial for implementing appropriate quick-relief medications and preventing progression to more severe episodes.

### symptoms of anaemia

Anaemia represents a condition characterized by insufficient red blood cells or haemoglobin concentration, resulting in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. The fundamental pathophysiology involves inadequate oxygen delivery to body tissues, which manifests through a constellation of symptoms that can significantly impact quality of life and functional capacity. The primary symptoms of anaemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness and shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion. These core manifestations reflect the body's compensatory responses to reduced oxygen availability. Additional symptoms encompass tiredness, light-headedness, drowsiness, and breathing difficulties that become more pronounced with activity. The severity and presentation of symptoms can vary considerably based on the underlying cause, rate of onset, and individual patient factors. In pediatric populations and pregnant women, anaemia presents particular clinical challenges with more severe cases leading to increased risk of maternal and child mortality. Beyond the immediate physical symptoms, anaemia has been demonstrated to affect cognitive and physical development in children while reducing productivity in adults. The condition serves as both a direct health concern and an indicator of broader nutritional and health status, potentially impacting other public health issues including stunting, wasting, and low birth weight.

### symptoms of Acute Coronary Syndrome

Acute coronary syndrome encompasses a spectrum of conditions resulting from decreased blood flow in the coronary arteries, preventing proper heart muscle function or causing tissue death. This syndrome includes ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina, each representing different degrees of coronary artery obstruction and myocardial damage. The most common symptom is centrally located pressure-like chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the jaw, and associated with nausea and sweating. The chest pain or discomfort typically manifests as pressure around the chest, tightness, burning or aching. This cardinal symptom may be accompanied by pain or discomfort that spreads to neck, jaw, shoulders, arms, stomach or back. Additional symptoms include shortness of breath, feeling dizzy or lightheaded, nausea, and sweating. It is important to note that many individuals with acute coronary syndromes, particularly women, older adults, and people with diabetes mellitus, may present with symptoms other than the classic chest pain presentation. The pain associated with acute coronary syndromes can appear suddenly or may be unpredictable, sometimes worsening even with rest, which distinguishes it from stable angina that typically resolves with rest.

### symptoms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease represents a progressive respiratory condition that makes breathing increasingly difficult over time. The disease typically begins with mild symptoms that may be mistaken for common respiratory infections, but progresses to more severe and persistent manifestations that significantly impact daily functioning and quality of life. Early symptoms include occasional shortness of breath, especially after exercise, mild but recurrent cough, and needing to clear the throat often, especially first thing in the morning. These initial manifestations often lead patients to make subtle behavioral changes such as avoiding stairs and skipping physical activities to compensate for their reduced exercise tolerance. As the disease progresses, symptoms can become more constant and may include shortness of breath after mild forms of exercise like walking up a flight of stairs, wheezing (a type of higher-pitched, noisy breathing, especially during exhalation), chest tightness, chronic cough with or without mucus, the need to clear mucus from the lungs every day, frequent colds, flu, or other respiratory infections, and lack of energy. In later stages of COPD, additional symptoms may manifest including fatigue, swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs, and weight loss. Emergency medical attention is required when patients experience bluish or gray fingernails or lips indicating low oxygen levels, trouble catching breath or inability to talk, confusion or faintness, or rapid heart rate.

### symptoms of Diabetic Foot Ulcers

Diabetic foot ulcers represent a serious complication of diabetes resulting from poor circulation, high blood sugar, and inadequate foot care. These ulcers form when skin tissue breaks down and exposes the underlying layers, most commonly occurring under the big toes and balls of the feet, potentially affecting tissue down to the bones.One of the first signs of a foot ulcer is drainage from the foot that might stain socks or leak out in shoes. Unusual swelling, irritation, redness, and odors from one or both feet are also common early symptoms. These initial manifestations may be subtle and easily overlooked, emphasizing the importance of regular foot inspection in diabetic patients.The most visible sign of a serious foot ulcer is black tissue (called eschar) surrounding the ulcer. This black tissue formation occurs due to absent healthy blood flow to the area around the ulcer. In cases where partial or complete gangrene develops, referring to tissue death due to infections, patients may experience odorous discharge, pain, and numbness. Importantly, signs of foot ulcers are not always obvious, and sometimes patients show no symptoms until the ulcer becomes infected.

### symptoms of Acute Diarrhoea

Acute diarrhoea is characterized by the sudden onset of loose, watery stools occurring three or more times per day, typically lasting less than 14 days. The primary symptom is the frequent passage of loose or liquid stools, often accompanied by urgency and incontinence. Associated symptoms commonly include abdominal cramping, pain, and discomfort that may be generalized or localized to specific quadrants of the abdomen.Patients frequently experience nausea and vomiting, particularly in cases caused by viral gastroenteritis or foodborne illnesses. Fever may be present, especially in bacterial or parasitic infections, and can range from low-grade to high-grade depending on the causative organism. Dehydration symptoms become apparent as fluid losses accumulate, including thirst, dry mouth, reduced urine output, dizziness, and lightheadedness.Additional symptoms may include bloating, gas, and a sense of incomplete evacuation. In severe cases, patients may develop signs of significant dehydration including decreased skin elasticity, sunken eyes, rapid heart rate, and low blood pressure. Blood or mucus in the stool may indicate inflammatory or invasive causes of diarrhoea and warrants immediate medical attention.

### symptoms of Adult Undifferentiated Acute Febrile Illness

Adult undifferentiated acute febrile illness refers to fever in adults without localizing signs or symptoms that would suggest a specific diagnosis. The hallmark symptom is fever, typically defined as a body temperature exceeding 38°C (100.4°F), which may be continuous, intermittent, or remittent in pattern. The fever is often accompanied by constitutional symptoms that reflect the body's systemic inflammatory response.Common associated symptoms include malaise, fatigue, and generalized weakness that can be profound and debilitating. Patients frequently experience headache, which may range from mild to severe and can be generalized or localized. Myalgias and arthralgias (muscle and joint pains) are common, often described as aching or soreness throughout the body.Additional symptoms may include chills and rigors, particularly during fever spikes, anorexia (loss of appetite), and sleep disturbances. Some patients develop nausea without vomiting, and mild dizziness or lightheadedness may occur, particularly when transitioning from lying to standing positions. The absence of localizing symptoms such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary complaints distinguishes this syndrome from more specific febrile conditions.

### symptoms of Heart Failure

Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood effectively to meet the body's metabolic demands. The symptoms of heart failure result from inadequate cardiac output and/or elevated filling pressures, leading to reduced perfusion of vital organs and fluid accumulation in various body compartments.The cardinal symptom of heart failure is dyspnea (shortness of breath), which initially occurs with exertion but may progress to occur at rest in advanced stages. Orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying flat) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (sudden awakening with shortness of breath) are characteristic symptoms that reflect elevated left-sided filling pressures. Patients often require multiple pillows to sleep comfortably or may need to sleep in a reclining chair.Fatigue and weakness are prominent symptoms resulting from reduced cardiac output and poor tissue perfusion. Lower extremity edema typically begins in the ankles and feet, progressing upward with worsening heart failure. Rapid weight gain due to fluid retention is a key indicator, with gains of 2-3 pounds over 1-2 days warranting medical attention. Additional symptoms include reduced exercise tolerance, nocturnal cough (often worse when lying down), abdominal distension from ascites, and early satiety from hepatic congestion.

### symptoms of Pneumonia

Pneumonia is an acute infection of the lung parenchyma that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other microorganisms. The clinical presentation reflects the inflammatory response in the lungs and systemic effects of infection. Symptoms can vary significantly based on the causative organism, patient age, immune status, and presence of underlying conditions.Cough is the most common symptom of pneumonia and may be productive of purulent, blood-tinged, or rust-colored sputum in bacterial pneumonia, while viral pneumonia often presents with a dry, non-productive cough. Fever is typically present and may be accompanied by chills and rigors, particularly in bacterial pneumonia. Dyspnea (shortness of breath) can range from mild to severe and may be accompanied by chest pain that is often pleuritic in nature, worsening with deep inspiration or coughing.Malaise, fatigue, and weakness are common constitutional symptoms reflecting the systemic inflammatory response. Headache and myalgias may accompany viral pneumonia. In elderly patients or those with compromised immune systems, symptoms may be more subtle, with confusion, altered mental status, or falls sometimes being the only presenting signs. Tachypnea (rapid breathing) and tachycardia (rapid heart rate) are common vital sign abnormalities that may indicate respiratory distress or systemic infection.

### symptoms of Stroke

Stroke is a neurological emergency caused by interrupted blood flow to the brain, either from vascular occlusion (ischemic stroke) or hemorrhage (hemorrhagic stroke). The symptoms of stroke reflect the specific brain regions affected and can vary dramatically based on the location and extent of brain tissue involvement. Recognition of stroke symptoms is critical for timely intervention and optimal outcomes.The acronym FAST (Face, Arms, Speech, Time) captures the most recognizable stroke symptoms. Facial drooping typically affects one side of the face, causing asymmetrical smile or inability to close one eyelid. Arm weakness manifests as inability to raise one or both arms or keep them raised, with one arm drifting downward. Speech difficulties include slurred speech, inability to speak, or difficulty understanding speech.Additional symptoms include sudden severe headache described as the worst headache of my life, particularly suggestive of hemorrhagic stroke. Vision changes can include sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes, double vision, or visual field defects. Balance and coordination problems may manifest as sudden dizziness, loss of balance, or coordination difficulties. Numbness or weakness affecting the face, arm, or leg, particularly on one side of the body, is a common presentation. Confusion, disorientation, or altered level of consciousness may occur, particularly in large strokes or those affecting critical brain regions.

# Disease Name : Anaemia

### Background

Point prevalence of anaemia is high in India. NFHS5 data: 57.2% of women aged 15–49 anaemic (Hb < 12 g/dL) - 54.1% urban, 58.7% rural; 25% of men aged 15–49 anaemic (Hb < 13 g/dL) - 20.4% urban, 27.4% rural. National Nutritional Anaemia Prevention Programme ➝ Free iron and folic acid supplementation for children, expectant/nursing mothers, women who attend family planning services. Has not been successful. 2013 ➝ National Iron Plus Initiative ➝ Free iron and folic acid for children/adolescents aged 10–19. Other programs in the past: Integrated Child Development Services, National Nutrition Policy, National Programme for Nutritional Support to Primary Education (Mid-day Meal Programme), 12 x 12 Initiative, Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Girls Empowerment of Adolescent Girls (SABLA), National Rural Health Mission. Currently ➝ Anemia Mukt Bharat. Despite multiple national programs targeting anaemia, prevalence remains high.

### Drivers of Anaemia in India

Inadequate dietary intake (vegetarian diet), loss of iron during menstrual cycle, repeated infections, poor absorption of iron due to gastrointestinal disorders, low bioavailability of iron in commonly consumed foods, poverty, and limited access to healthcare contribute to the high prevalence of anaemia in India. Additionally, social and cultural factors, such as early marriage and high fertility rates, can exacerbate the condition, particularly in women and children. The lack of awareness about anaemia prevention and treatment further contributes to the persistence of this public health issue.

### Barriers to Improving Anaemia

Inadequate supplies and coverage of programs, lack of education, and poor compliance are key barriers to improving anaemia in India. Programs may not reach all target populations due to logistical issues and resource limitations. Education on the importance of iron and folic acid supplementation is often insufficient, and cultural beliefs and practices may impact compliance with supplementation. Additionally, the consistency and availability of programs can be a challenge in rural and underserved areas.

### Causes of Anaemia (with an emphasis on LMICs)

Anaemia in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) can be attributed to multiple factors. Decreased production of red blood cells is a significant cause, including iron deficiency, other nutritional deficiencies (such as folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin A), and depressed bone marrow function due to various conditions. Infectious diseases like HIV and leishmaniasis, as well as renal failure, can also impair red blood cell production. Loss of RBCs due to acute or chronic haemorrhage is another cause, often resulting from conditions like gastrointestinal bleeding or trauma. Increased destruction (haemolysis) of red blood cells can occur in infections such as malaria and HIV, as well as in genetic disorders like sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Drug-induced haemolysis, such as reactions seen with G6PD deficiency, also contributes to anaemia in affected populations.

### Iron-deficiency Anaemia (IDA) vs Non-iron Deficiency Anaemia (NIDA)

It is likely that the vast majority of anaemia in India is Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA). In a 2007 study of 100 non-pregnant, non-lactating women in Bangalore, 95% of anaemic women were iron deficient. A 2022 study of 258 mothers (pregnant or post-natal) revealed that 65.9% of the women were anaemic, with 61.8% having normal ferritin levels. However, risk of confounding exists here, as the patient population should have been started on iron supplementation during pregnancy. The Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) provides more data but only sampled patients aged between 0-19. In this survey, 12% of children aged 10-19 were anaemic and iron deficient, while 16.9% of the same group were anaemic but NOT iron deficient.

### If Patient is Unstable

Resuscitate the patient according to local protocols. If the patient is actively bleeding, achieve haemostasis. Transfer the patient for blood transfusion and further management if required.

### Clinical Patterns and Contributing Factors in Anaemia

Anaemia may present with various clinical patterns depending on the underlying cause. Key considerations include diet and nutritional deficiencies, which are common contributors. Acute blood loss is another critical factor that should be assessed. A personal or family history of anaemia may indicate a hereditary or genetic syndrome. It is also important to evaluate menstrual history, alcohol intake, and the presence of renal disease or other underlying illnesses. Infectious causes such as malaria and helminth infections should be considered in relevant settings. Genetic conditions like thalassemia and sickle cell disease are significant contributors and should be part of the differential diagnosis.

### Initial Testing and Assessment of Anaemia

The first-line test in evaluating anaemia is Hemo-cue (point-of-care haemoglobin testing). If haemoglobin (Hb) is found to be less than 8 g/dL, indicating severe anaemia, transfusion should be considered based on local protocols. If a complete blood count (CBC) is available, it should be performed, as Hb and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) provide valuable information for further assessment. In the absence of CBC, empirical treatment should be guided by the most likely cause, considering the patient’s age, demographics, local epidemiology, and clinical clues from the history.

### Interpretation of Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) in Anaemia

Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is a key parameter in the evaluation of anaemia. If MCV is less than 80 fL, it suggests microcytic anaemia, commonly caused by iron deficiency, thalassemia, or anaemia of chronic disease. An MCV between 80–100 fL indicates normocytic anaemia, with possible causes including iron deficiency, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, anaemia of chronic disease, drug-induced anaemia, infections, liver disease or alcohol use, haemolysis, hypothyroidism, and other conditions. When MCV is greater than 100 fL, it suggests macrocytic anaemia, which may be due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, drug-induced causes, liver disease or alcohol use, a high reticulocyte count, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or other less common conditions.

### Protocal for test iron deficiency anaemia

When iron deficiency anaemia is suspected, treatment should begin promptly. Oral iron is recommended for mild anaemia, while intravenous (IV) iron is preferred for moderate to severe cases. The Indian government provides combined iron-folic acid tablets containing 100 mg of elemental iron and 500 mcg of folic acid. In cases of life-threatening anaemia, consider the need for blood transfusion and arrange transfer to the nearest district hospital. A single dose of oral Albendazole 400 mg should also be given on an empty stomach to address possible helminth infection.

If thalassemia is suspected—indicated by a low MCV that is disproportionate to the severity of anaemia—refer the patient for haemoglobin electrophoresis and specialist management. If iron deficiency coexists, it should still be treated with oral or IV iron.

If sickle cell disease is suspected, particularly in cases of severe anaemia or with a relevant family history, a point-of-care (POC) screening test such as HemotypeSC can be used. Confirmation should be done via laboratory testing, preferably with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

### Follow-up for Treated Iron Deficiency Anaemia

Haemoglobin (Hb) levels should be re-checked one month after initiating treatment for iron deficiency anaemia. If there is improvement in Hb, iron replacement therapy should be continued. Typically, 3 to 6 months of therapy are needed to fully replenish iron stores. If there is no improvement after one month, the diagnosis should be reassessed using the clinical pathway. Potential underlying causes should be investigated, including parasitic infections (requiring deworming), menstrual bleeding, peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal malignancies, and other contributing factors.

### Iron Deficiency anaemia unlikely

For iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), initiate iron replacement therapy. Oral iron is suitable for mild anaemia, while intravenous (IV) iron is recommended for moderate to severe cases. The Indian government provides combined iron-folic acid tablets containing 100 mg of elemental iron and 500 mcg of folic acid. In life-threatening anaemia, assess the need for a blood transfusion and arrange transfer to the nearest district hospital. Administer a single dose of oral Albendazole 400 mg on an empty stomach to address possible parasitic infection. Follow up by rechecking haemoglobin (Hb) after one month. If Hb has improved, continue iron therapy for 3–6 months to fully replenish iron stores. If there is no improvement, reassess the diagnosis and consider other underlying causes such as parasitic infections, menstrual bleeding, peptic ulcers, or gastrointestinal malignancies.

Thalassemia should be suspected if the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is disproportionately low relative to the severity of anaemia. Refer such cases for haemoglobin electrophoresis and further management. If iron deficiency coexists, it should still be treated with either oral or IV iron.

For suspected sickle cell disease, consider the diagnosis in cases of severe anaemia or if there is a family history. A point-of-care screening test such as HemotypeSC may be used, with confirmation via laboratory testing such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Anaemia of chronic disease should also be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained anaemia.

### Causes of Normocytic Anaemia

Normocytic anaemia refers to anaemia with a normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Common causes include nutritional deficiencies such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency. Anaemia of chronic disease is also a frequent contributor. Other causes include chronic kidney disease, heart failure, hypothyroidism, and various endocrine disorders. Cancer and stem cell disorders may also present with normocytic anaemia. Additionally, it can be seen in early stages of blood loss or in partially treated anaemia.

### Next Steps When Iron Stores Are Normal

If iron stores are found to be normal, further evaluation is necessary to identify the cause of anaemia. Nutritional deficiencies, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be considered. Haemolysis is another possible cause and should be investigated. Empirical therapy with vitamin B12 and folate may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts. Additionally, underlying illnesses including anaemia of chronic disease should be considered as potential contributors.

### Common Causes of Macrocytic Anaemia

Macrocytic anaemia is characterised by an increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Common causes include vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, which are among the most frequent nutritional contributors. Drug-induced anaemia should also be considered. Liver disease and alcohol use are known to affect red blood cell production and can lead to macrocytosis. A high reticulocyte count may indicate increased red blood cell turnover. Other causes include myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and various less common conditions.

### Empirical Treatment and Follow-up for Suspected B12 and Folate Deficiency

When vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is suspected, empirical treatment may be initiated. For vitamin B12 deficiency, administer 1000 mcg of vitamin B12 intramuscularly as an initial dose, followed by 1000 mcg of oral vitamin B12 daily. For folate deficiency, prescribe 1–5 grams of folic acid orally per day.

Follow-up should include rechecking haemoglobin (Hb) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) after one month to assess response to treatment. If there is no response, further assessment is necessary, which may involve additional diagnostic testing or referral to a specialist.

### Next Steps When B12 and Folate Levels Are Normal

If vitamin B12 and folate levels are within the normal range, further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of anaemia. Consider testing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to assess for hypothyroidism. Assess alcohol use as a contributing factor. Additional investigations may include serum copper levels, a peripheral blood smear for morphological clues, and liver function tests to identify hepatic causes of anaemia.

### Prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency among children and adolescents, India, CNNS 2016-18

The Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) provides data on anaemia and iron deficiency in children and adolescents aged 0-19. The figure presented shows the prevalence of these conditions among different age groups: 1-4 years, 5-9 years, and 10-19 years. The data is categorized into four groups: 'Anaemic and iron deficient', 'Iron deficient but not anaemic', 'Anaemic but not iron deficient', and 'No anaemia and no iron deficiency', with percentages indicated for each category within each age group.

In the 1-4 years age group, 20.8% were anaemic and iron deficient, 17.9% were iron deficient but not anaemic, 10.9% were anaemic but not iron deficient, and 50.3% had no anaemia and no iron deficiency. For the 5-9 years age group, 6.5% were anaemic and iron deficient, 16.4% were iron deficient but not anaemic, 10.6% were anaemic but not iron deficient, and 66.5% had no anaemia and no iron deficiency. Among the 10-19 years age group, 12.0% were anaemic and iron deficient, 16.9% were iron deficient but not anaemic, 9.5% were anaemic but not iron deficient, and 61.7% had no anaemia and no iron deficiency.

Overall, the survey highlights the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency across these age groups in India based on the CNNS 2016-18 data. Notably, within the 10-19 year age group, the text accompanying the figure states that 12% of children aged 10-19 were anaemic and iron deficient, and 16.9% of the same group were anaemic but NOT iron deficient, which aligns with the percentages shown in the bar chart for this age category.

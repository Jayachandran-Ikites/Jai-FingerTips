Anaemia Pathway
#L2
**Background**
#L3
- Point prevalence of anaemia is high in India
#L4
  - [NFHS5 data](http://rchiips.org/nfhs/NFHS-5_FCTS/India.pdf):
#L5
    o 57.2% of women aged 15-49 anaemic (Hb < 12)
#L6
      ▪︎ 54.1% urban, 58.7% rural
#L7
    o 25% of men aged 15-49 anaemic (Hb < 13)
#L8
      ▪︎ 20.4% urban, 27.4% rural
#L9
- National Nutritional Anaemia Prevention Programme  free iron and folic acid
#L10
  supplementation for children, expectant/nursing mothers, women who attend family
#L11

#L12
  o Has not been successful
#L13
- 2013  National Iron Plus Initiative  free iron and folic acid for children/adolescents

  aged 10-19
#L15
- Other programs in the past
#L16
  o Integrated Child Development Services
#L17
  o National Nutrition Policy
#L18
  o National Programme for Nutritional Support to Primary Education (Mid-day Meal
#L19
    Programme)
#L20
  o 12 x 12 Initiative
#L21
  o Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Girls Empowerment of Adolescent, SABLA
#L22
  o National Rural Health Mission
#L23
- Currently  Anemia Mukt Bharat
#L24
- Despite multiple national programs targeting anaemia, overall rates of anaemia have not
#L25
  decreased (per serial NFHS’)
#L26
**Drivers of anaemia in India**
#L27
- Inadequate dietary intake (vegetarian diet)
#L28
- Loss of iron during menstrual cycle
#L29
- Repeated pregnancy/lactation
#L30
- Infections
#L31
**Barriers to improving anaemia**
#L32
- Inadequate supplies/coverage of programs
#L33
- Education
#L34
- Compliance
#L35
**Relevant documents**
#L36
- [National Rural Health Mission Guidelines for Control of IDA](https://www.nhm.gov.in/images/pdf/programmes/child-health/guidelines/Control-of-Iron-Deficiency-Anaemia.pdf)
#L37
- [Anemia Mukt Bharat Intensified National Iron Plus Initiative](https://anemiamuktbharat.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Anemia-Mukt-Bharat-Brochure_English.pdf)
#L38
**Causes of anaemia (with an emphasis on LMICs)**
#L39
- Decreased production
#L40
  o Iron deficiency
#L41
  o Other nutritional deficiencies (folic acid, B12, A)
#L42
  o Depressed bone marrow function
#L43
  o Infectious (HIV, leishmania)
#L44
  o Renal failure
#L45
- Loss of RBCs
#L46
  o Acute or chronic haemorrhage
#L47
- Increased destruction (haemolysis)
#L48
  o Infections (malaria, HIV)
#L49
  o Haemoglobinopathy (sickle cell, thalassemia)
#L50
  o Drug reaction (e.g. G6PD deficiency)
#L51
**Iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) vs non-iron deficiency anaemia (NIDA)**
#L52
- It is likely that the vast majority of anaemia in India is IDA
#L53
- In a [2007 study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/156482650702800309) of 100 non-pregnant, non-lactating women in Bangalore, 95% of anaemic
#L54
  women were iron deficient
#L55
- In a [2022 study](https://www.cureus.com/articles/111948-non-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-rural-indian-women-a-cross-sectional-study#references) of 258 mothers (pregnant or post-natal), 65.9% were anaemic. Of women
#L56
  with anaemia, 61.8% had normal ferritin levels
#L57
  o However, risk of confounding here – given the patient population should have
#L58
    been commenced on iron supplementation at time of pregnancy
#L59
- The [Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS)](https://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/2019RH_CNNSreport.pdf) provides more data, but only
#L60
  sampled patients aged between 0-19
#L61
  o In the survey, 12% of children aged 10-19 were anaemic and iron deficient and
#L62
    16.9% of the same group were anaemic but NOT iron deficient

#I1
According to Figure 6.6 from the CNNS 2016–18 report on India, the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency varies among different age groups of children and adolescents. For children aged 1–4 years, 20.8% are both anaemic and iron deficient, 17.9% are iron deficient but not anaemic, 10.9% are anaemic but not iron deficient, and 50.3% have neither condition. In the 5–9 years age group, 6.5% are anaemic and iron deficient, 16.4% are iron deficient but not anaemic, 10.6% are anaemic but not iron deficient, and 66.5% are unaffected by either. Among adolescents aged 10–19 years, 12.0% are anaemic and iron deficient, 16.9% are iron deficient but not anaemic, 9.5% are anaemic but not iron deficient, and 61.7% have no anaemia and no iron deficiency.

#L63
**Anaemia Sequence**
#L64
**Is the patient stable/actively bleeding**
#L65
- If there is active bleeding, achieve haemostasis. Refer for blood transfusion and further
#L66
  management
#L67
**Consider anaemia patterns based on clinical presentation**
#L68
- Diet/nutritional deficiency
#L69
- Acute blood loss
#L70
- Personal or family history of anaemia
#L71
  o Suggests hereditary/genetic syndrome
#L72
- Menstrual history
#L73
- Alcohol intake
#L74
- Renal disease
#L75
- Underlying illness
#L76
- Malaria
#L77
- Helminth infection
#L78
- Thalassemia
#L79
- Sickle cell disease
#L80
**Initial test (first line)**
#L81
- Hemo-cue (POC Hb)
#L82
- Is Hb < 8 (severe anaemia)?
#L83
  o **Transfusion based on local protocol**
#L84
- Is CBC available?
#L85
  o If yes, perform CBC (Hb and MCV inform further assessment)
#L86
  o If no, treat empirically for most likely cause based on age, demographics, local
#L87
    epidemiology, clues from history
#L88
**What is the MCV?**
#L89
- MCV < 80 fL
#L90
  o Common causes: iron deficiency, thalassemia, anaemia of chronic disease
#L91
- MCV 80-100 fL
#L92
  o Iron deficiency
#L93
  o B12 or folate deficiency
#L94
  o Anaemia of chronic disease
#L95
  o Drug-induced
#L96
  o Infection
#L97
  o Liver disease/alcohol
#L98
  o Haemolysis
#L99
  o Hypothyroid
#L100
  o Other
#L101
- MCV > 100 fL
#L102
  o B12 or folate deficiency
#L103
  o Drug-induced
#L104
  o Liver disease/alcohol use
#L105
  o High reticulocyte count
#L106
  o MDS
#L107
  o Other
#L108
**IF MCV < 80**
#L109
- Is ferritin testing or transferrin saturation available?
#L110
  - If ferritin < 30 ng/mL, **treat as iron deficiency**
#L111
  - If ferritin > 30 ng/mL, then check transferrin saturation
#L112
    o If TSAT < 20%, then treat as IDA
#L113
    o If TSAT > 20%, then IDA unlikely
#L114
      ▪︎ Consider anaemia of chronic disease or thalassemia
#L115
    o If MCV is low out of proportion to Hb, suspect thalassemia
#L116
- If ferritin/TSAT not available:
#L117
  o Empirically treat for iron deficiency anaemia
#L118
  o (same treatment as below)
#L119
- If IDA:
#L120
  o Commence iron replacement
#L121
    ▪︎ PO iron for mild anaemia, IV iron for moderate-severe anaemia
#L122
      ● Indian government offers combined iron-folic acid pills containing
#L123
        100mg elemental iron and 500mcg of folic acid
#L124
    ▪︎ Consider need for blood transfusion if life-threatening anaemia – this will
#L125
      require transfer to the closest district hospital
#L126
    ▪︎ PO Albendazole 400mg once on an empty stomach
#L127
  o Re-check Hb in 1 month for response
#L128
    ▪︎ If Hb improved, continue iron replacement
#L129
    ▪︎ 3-6 months of therapy are required for replenish iron stores
#L130
    ▪︎ If not improved after 1 month: re-consider diagnosis (see pathway)
#L131
  o Address underlying cause
#L132
    ▪︎ Parasites? (deworming), menstrual bleeding, peptic ulcer, GI malignancy,
#L133
      etc.
#L134
- If thalassemia suspected
#L135
  o Suspect if MCV out of proportion to the degree of anaemia
#L136
  o Refer for electrophoresis and further management
#L137
  o If patient has suspected thalassemia and is also iron deficient, iron deficiency
#L138
    should still be treated (with PO or IV iron)
#L139
- If sickle cell suspected
#L140
  o Consider if severe anaemia or family history
#L141
  o POC screening test for sickle cell (HemotypeSC is one POC test)
#L142
  o Confirmatory test – send to lab (HPLC)
#L143
- Anaemia of chronic disease

#L144
**IF MCV > 100**
#L145
- Send B12 and folate levels if available
#L146
  o If low, then replace
#L147
    o B12:
#L148
      ▪︎ Give 1000mcg vitamin B12 IM once
#L149
      ▪︎ Then give 1000 mcg vitamin B12 PO daily
#L150
    o Folate
#L151
      ▪︎ Give 1-5g folic acid PO daily
#L152
- If B12 and folate normal, consider TSH, alcohol use, serum copper, peripheral blood
#L153
  smear, liver function
#L154
- If no testing, treat empirically for B12 and folate deficiency
#L155
  o B12:
#L156
    ▪︎ Give 1000mcg vitamin B12 IM once
#L157
    ▪︎ Then give 1000 mcg vitamin B12 PO daily
#L158
  o Folate
#L159
    ▪︎ Give 1-5g folic acid PO daily
#L160
- Re-check Hb and MCV in 1 month for response to treatment
#L161
- If no response  Perform further assessment. May require additional diagnostic testing or
#L162
  referral
#L163
**IF MCV 80-100**
#L164
- Normocytic anaemia
#L165
- Causes:
#L166
  o Nutritional deficiency (iron, B12, folate deficiency)
#L167
  o Anaemia of chronic disease
#L168
  o Chronic kidney disease
#L169
  o Heart failure
#L170
  o Hypothyroidism
#L171
  o Endocrine
#L172
  o Cancer
#L173
  o Stem cell disorder
#L174
  o Early blood loss
#L175
  o Partially treated anaemia
#L176
- Is there access to iron studies/further testing?
#L177
  o If no, consider concurrent iron/b12/folate therapy
#L178
- Perform iron studies (ferritin and transferrin saturation)
#L179
  o If iron deficiency  treat
#L180
  o Re-check after 1 month
#L181
- If iron stores normal
#L182
  o Consider nutritional causes
#L183
  o Consider haemolysis
#L184
  o Consider therapy with B12 and folate
#L185
  o Consider underlying illness/anaemia of chronic disease
#L186
**How to give IV iron**
#L187
- Is there local capacity to give IV iron infusion
#L188
  o If no, then refer to district hospital/closest centre with capacity
#L189
  o If yes, then which preparation?
#L190
    ▪︎ IV iron sucrose (most common)
#L191
      ● Give 200mg in 100ml normal saline IV over 30 minutes daily until
#L192
        desired dose is reached
#L193
        o Use [Ganzoni equation](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/10139/ganzoni-equation-iron-deficiency-anemia) for iron deficiency anaemia
#L194
        o Total iron deficit, mg = weight, kg x (target hemoglobin,
#L195
          g/dL – actual hemoglobin, g/dL) x 2.4 + iron stores, mg
#L196
    ▪︎ Iron Carboxymaltose (more expensive)
#L197
      ● 1gm in 100ml normal saline IV over 30 minutes
#L198
**If Malaria**
#L199
- See CSA malaria pathway (to be developed with the other fever content)
#L200
- Leads to anaemia through destruction of RBCs, and decreased RBC production
#L201
- Diagnose and treat as per [National Malaria Guidelines](https://nvbdcp.gov.in/WriteReadData/l892s/20627628441542176662.pdf)
#L202
- Diagnosis
#L203
  o Microscopy (thick and thin smear) or rapid diagnostic test
#L204
- Treatment
#L205
  o P. vivax: chloroquine or primaquine
#L206
  o P. falciparum: Artemisinin combination therapy

**Comprehensive Acute Coronary Syndrome Pathway**
#L2
**Introduction**
#L3
This document presents a comprehensive Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) pathway tailored for
#L4
resource-poor settings in India. It addresses the unique challenges faced in these settings while
#L5
leveraging existing infrastructure and government initiatives to improve ACS care outcomes.
#L6
**Clinical Pathway**
#L7
**1. Initial Assessment and Triage (0-5 minutes)**
#L8
*Standard Approach*
#L9
- Rapid assessment of consciousness, breathing, and circulation
#L10
- Quick pain assessment using OPQRST method
#L11
*Indian Context Adaptation*
#L12
- Emphasis on visual assessment due to potential lack of monitoring equipment
#L13
- Training for healthcare workers to perform quick manual BP measurements
#L14
- Use of locally relevant pain scales (e.g., visual analog scale with culturally appropriate images)
#L15
**2. ECG Assessment (within 15 minutes of arrival)**
#L16
*Standard Approach*
#L17
- 12-lead ECG performed and interpreted by trained personnel
#L18
*Indian Context Adaptation*
#L19
- Alternatives for facilities without ECG machines:
#L20
  - Use of smartphone-based ECG devices (e.g., AliveCor; https://alivecor.in)
#L21
- Telemedicine linkages with district hospitals for remote ECG interpretation
#L22
- Training of local healthcare workers in basic ECG interpretation
#L23
- Collaboration with state governments to improve ECG availability in rural areas
#L24
**3. Initial Management**
#L25
*Standard Approach*
#L26
- Oxygen therapy if needed (if patient has hypoxia; no significant benefit in the absence of it-

#L28
  tion%20with%20myocardial%20infarction.; Hofmann and in NEJM have shown the results of a
#L29
  registry-based, randomized clinical trial of the use of supplemental oxygen in 6629 patients in
#L30
  Sweden who had suspected acute myocardial infarction and did not have hypoxemia. Patients
#L31
  were randomly assigned to supplemental oxygen administered through an open face mask (6
#L32
  liters per minute for 6 to 12 hours) or to ambient air. The trial was adequately sized for the
#L33
  assessment of hard clinical end points, with a primary end point of death from any cause at 1
#L34
  year. Supplemental oxygen was not associated with lower all-cause mortality at 1 year than
#L35
  ambient air, and the rate of a key secondary end point — rehospitalization for acute myocardial
#L36
  infarction within 1 year — also did not differ significantly between the study groups. These
#L37
  results clearly support the view that supplemental oxygen offers no benefit in patients with acute
#L38
  myocardial infarction who have normal oxygen saturation.
#L39
- oxygen therapy in the absence of hypoxemia may even be harmful
#L40
- Pain management
#L41

Oxygen if needed, start IV if you can
#L48
**If it's a STEMI:**
#L49
Add Clopidogrel 300 mg
#L50
o Costs ₹15-20, available as Jan Aushadhi Clopidogrel
#L51
Arrange transfer to a PCI center if it’s less than 2 hours away

#L58
Jan Aushadhi availability: No
#L59
Typical market price: ₹150-200 per 5000 IU vial

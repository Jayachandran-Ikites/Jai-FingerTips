### summary of all the diseases

Anaemia, a condition marked by low haemoglobin levels, is prevalent among children and adolescents in India and is often linked to iron deficiency. Data from the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) 2016–18 reveals that significant proportions of individuals aged 1–19 fall into categories such as iron-deficient anaemia, iron deficiency without anaemia, and anaemia from non-iron causes. Diagnosis typically involves haemoglobin and iron profile tests (like serum ferritin) to differentiate between types. Treatment includes iron supplementation, dietary improvement with iron-rich foods, and addressing underlying non-nutritional causes when present. The CNNS data underscores the need for age-targeted interventions to combat both iron deficiency and anaemia. Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by symptoms such as dyspnea, chest tightness, cough, and wheezing, which often vary over time and worsen at night or with triggers like exercise, allergens, or infections. Diagnosis primarily relies on spirometry showing airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC <0.7) with reversibility after bronchodilator use, or alternatively, peak expiratory flow improvement post-bronchodilator when spirometry is unavailable. Initial management includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures such as smoking cessation and trigger avoidance. Pharmacological treatment follows a stepwise approach based on severity and age, starting with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) combined with rapid-onset long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) or short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) as needed, escalating to higher ICS doses, addition of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and possibly biologics for severe cases. Exacerbations require prompt assessment and treatment with SABAs, systemic corticosteroids, oxygen, and careful monitoring. Personalized asthma action plans and vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19) are integral to ongoing management. Avoidance of SABA monotherapy and oral steroids as first-line treatment is emphasized. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2023 guidelines provide detailed, individualized protocols to optimize asthma control and minimize risks. This Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) pathway is specifically designed for resource-limited healthcare settings in India, addressing local challenges such as limited equipment and trained personnel. It emphasizes rapid initial assessment using adapted pain scales and manual vital sign checks, with ECG ideally done within 15 minutes—leveraging smartphone ECG devices and telemedicine where standard machines are unavailable. Initial management prioritizes oxygen only if hypoxic, immediate aspirin administration, and use of affordable medications like nitroglycerine, clopidogrel, and anticoagulants (heparin or enoxaparin) based on the type of ACS. A tiered referral network aligns with India’s healthcare structure, utilizing ambulances, community vehicles, and digital communication tools for timely transfer to PCI centers or thrombolysis when needed. Community engagement uses culturally appropriate education methods such as folk media and multilingual materials, while resource access is enhanced through government schemes like Jan Aushadhi and Ayushman Bharat. Training programs target healthcare workers at all levels with ongoing support via mobile apps and medical colleges. Monitoring involves simplified audits and collaboration with national research bodies to improve rural ACS care continuously. Overall, this pathway adapts international guidelines with practical, cost-effective solutions to improve ACS outcomes in rural India.

Overall, this pathway adapts international guidelines with practical, cost-effective solutions to improve ACS outcomes in rural India. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in India presents significant diagnostic and management challenges due to limited access to spirometry and variable provider training, as well as distinctive risk factors like biomass fuel exposure and post-tuberculosis lung disease. Diagnosis relies primarily on symptoms such as chronic cough and dyspnea, supported by spirometry when available, with a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70 confirming COPD. Differential diagnoses, including asthma, bronchiectasis, and heart failure, must be ruled out through clinical evaluation and investigations like chest X-ray. Severity is assessed using the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) breathlessness scale and exacerbation history, guiding therapy initiation from as-needed bronchodilators for mild cases to combination long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for more severe or frequently exacerbating patients. Non-pharmacological interventions such as smoking cessation, reducing indoor pollution exposure, pulmonary rehabilitation, and nutrition optimization are essential. Pharmacological treatment begins with short-acting bronchodilators progressing to long-acting agents, with escalation based on symptom control, exacerbations, and blood eosinophil counts. Management of comorbidities, prevention via vaccination, and careful monitoring of exacerbations, including appropriate antibiotic and steroid use, are critical. Advanced COPD may require home oxygen therapy based on oxygen saturation and clinical criteria, while ongoing care emphasizes regular follow-up, adherence, inhaler technique, and adjustment of therapy. Cost constraints, cultural factors affecting inhaler use, and reliance on less effective treatments like theophylline highlight the need for accessible, practical approaches tailored to Indian healthcare realities.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) affect around 18.6 million people globally each year, with significant risks including infection, amputation, and high mortality rates—particularly among those undergoing above-foot amputations. These ulcers often arise from diabetic complications such as peripheral neuropathy and peripheral artery disease, which impair sensation and blood flow, increasing vulnerability to unnoticed injuries and poor wound healing. Diagnosis involves screening for neuropathy using tools like the monofilament test, tuning fork, or Ipswich Touch Test, and assessing vascular status through the ankle-brachial or toe-brachial index, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure. The Wound, Ischemia, and Foot Infection (WIfI) classification system is commonly used to stratify ulcer severity and predict outcomes. Management centers on three pillars: debridement to remove nonviable tissue, off-loading using nonremovable knee-high devices to reduce pressure, and selecting appropriate wound dressings based on exudate and infection. Infected ulcers may require antibiotics or surgical intervention, while timely revascularization is critical for those with peripheral arterial disease to promote healing and avoid limb loss.

Acute diarrhoea, defined as the passage of three or more loose or watery stools in 24 hours, is a significant public health issue in India, being the fourth leading cause of death and the top infectious cause of mortality, particularly affecting the elderly. The primary causes include a wide range of pathogens—viruses (e.g., rotavirus, norovirus), bacteria (e.g., E. coli, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae), and protozoa—with many cases resolving without the need for antibiotics. However, misuse of antibiotics is common due to over-the-counter availability and lack of diagnostic clarity. Diagnosis involves assessing patient stability, dehydration severity, and ruling out other serious conditions. Microbiological testing and antibiotic use are reserved for severe or prolonged cases, or when symptoms such as bloody stools or sepsis are present. Treatment primarily focuses on rehydration—oral for mild/moderate dehydration and intravenous for severe cases. When antibiotics are indicated, targeted regimens like doxycycline for cholera or ciprofloxacin/azithromycin for Shigella are recommended. Discharge guidelines emphasize continued hydration, hygiene practices, and clear instructions for follow-up in case of symptom worsening.

Discharge guidelines emphasize continued hydration, hygiene practices, and clear instructions for follow-up in case of symptom worsening. Adult Undifferentiated Acute Febrile Illness (AFI) is defined as a fever of less than 2 weeks’ duration in adults, without an identifiable source after initial clinical evaluation and basic investigations. Common causes include viral infections (such as dengue, chikungunya, influenza, and COVID-19), bacterial infections (like typhoid, leptospirosis, and scrub typhus), parasitic infections (notably malaria), and other region-specific illnesses (e.g., rickettsial infections, hantavirus, Q fever, brucellosis). Patients typically present with high-grade fever, headache, myalgia, chills, and fatigue, with variable features like rash, jaundice, cough, gastrointestinal symptoms, or bleeding depending on the underlying etiology. Danger signs requiring urgent care include altered mental status, respiratory distress, hypotension, bleeding, or reduced urine output. Evaluation involves a detailed history (including travel, exposures, and outbreaks), physical exam (looking for rash, eschar, hepatosplenomegaly, etc.), and baseline investigations like CBC, LFTs, RFTs, peripheral smear for malaria, rapid diagnostic tests (e.g., dengue NS1, malaria antigen, Typhidot, Leptospira IgM), and further tests (blood cultures, chest X-ray, lumbar puncture, or serologies) guided by clinical suspicion. Management is largely supportive with antipyretics, fluids, and monitoring, while empirical treatment may include doxycycline or azithromycin for suspected bacterial infections and antimalarials if malaria is confirmed. NSAIDs should be avoided, particularly in suspected dengue. Patients without red flags can often be managed as outpatients, while hospitalization is warranted for those with shock, organ dysfunction, bleeding, altered sensorium, or severe disease requiring close monitoring or specific therapies.

Patients without red flags can often be managed as outpatients, while hospitalization is warranted for those with shock, organ dysfunction, bleeding, altered sensorium, or severe disease requiring close monitoring or specific therapies. Heart failure (HF) is a major health concern that is broadly classified into heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Although these two types have distinct underlying mechanisms, they often present with similar clinical symptoms, making diagnosis based on symptoms alone difficult. In India, the burden of HF is substantial, with past estimates indicating 1.3 to 4.6 million cases and a one-year mortality rate of 23%. Ischemic heart disease (IHD), the leading cause of death in the country, contributes significantly to the development of HF. Management of HF, especially HFrEF, involves a combination of symptomatic and disease-modifying treatments. Disease-modifying therapy includes the use of four core drug classes: angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which have shown significant mortality and morbidity benefits in major trials. When initiating treatment, careful monitoring of blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes is essential. In cases where ARNIs or SGLT2 inhibitors are not available due to cost or access limitations, alternative regimens using ACE inhibitors or ARBs can be employed, although the full benefit of comprehensive therapy may not be achieved. HFpEF, on the other hand, lacks proven disease-modifying therapies, and its management focuses primarily on controlling comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. Diuretics are used in both types to manage symptoms of fluid overload. Referral to specialist cardiology services is necessary for patients with complications, diagnostic uncertainty, or those who may benefit from advanced therapies. Despite challenges in availability and affordability of medications, especially in low-resource settings, implementing guideline-directed medical therapy and integrating care with related protocols (e.g., for diabetes, hypertension, and IHD) can significantly improve outcomes in patients with HF.

Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in one or both lungs, leading to fluid or pus accumulation in the air sacs and resulting in symptoms such as cough with phlegm, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. It can be caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The initial assessment begins with evaluating patient stability and, if stable, involves differential diagnosis and pulse oximetry. Chest radiography may be used to confirm community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), though it may be skipped in low-risk outpatient cases. Diagnosis should include screening for COVID-19, influenza, and tuberculosis based on clinical suspicion and season. Treatment decisions depend on severity, using tools like CRB-65 or CURB-65 to guide outpatient, inpatient, or ICU care. Outpatients without risk factors are treated empirically with antibiotics like amoxicillin or doxycycline, while those with comorbidities may require broader-spectrum regimens. Inappropriate interventions, such as unnecessary cultures or broad-spectrum antibiotics, should be avoided in outpatients. ICU admission follows ATS/IDSA criteria and involves empiric treatment with ceftriaxone plus a macrolide, along with blood and sputum cultures. Inpatients not requiring ICU care receive similar empiric therapy. Management of suspected or confirmed MRSA or Pseudomonas infections includes adding agents like vancomycin or piperacillin-tazobactam, guided by cultures or PCR. Ongoing inpatient care involves reassessment, possible antibiotic de-escalation, and discharge planning with follow-up visits and vaccination reviews. In influenza-positive CAP, oseltamivir is initiated within three days of symptom onset, alongside empirical antibiotics to prevent bacterial co-infection.

Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality in India, with significant variation in prevalence and outcomes between rural and urban populations. It primarily occurs in two forms: ischaemic (88% of global cases) and haemorrhagic (10% intracerebral, 2% subarachnoid), each requiring distinct treatments. Diagnosis depends critically on timely access to CT imaging to differentiate stroke type. Ischaemic strokes are treated with aspirin, statins, and in eligible cases, thrombolysis using alteplase, ideally within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. In resource-limited settings or when imaging is unavailable, cautious aspirin use may still be considered. Haemorrhagic strokes require blood pressure control and reversal of anticoagulation, often needing transfer to specialized centers. Secondary prevention includes controlling risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypercholesterolemia, alongside lifestyle changes. Rehabilitation is essential for recovery and involves early initiation, functional assessments, and potentially telehealth. Challenges in India include delayed presentation, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to stroke-ready facilities, making timely and effective stroke care difficult, especially in rural areas.

Data from the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) 2016–18 reveals that significant proportions of individuals aged 1–19 fall into categories such as iron-deficient anaemia, iron deficiency without anaemia, and anaemia from non-iron causes. Diagnosis typically involves haemoglobin and iron profile tests (like serum ferritin) to differentiate between types. Treatment includes iron supplementation, dietary improvement with iron-rich foods, and addressing underlying non-nutritional causes when present. The CNNS data underscores the need for age-targeted interventions to combat both iron deficiency and anaemia.

### summary of all the diseases

Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality in India, with significant variation in prevalence and outcomes between rural and urban populations. It primarily occurs in two forms: ischaemic (88% of global cases) and haemorrhagic (10% intracerebral, 2% subarachnoid), each requiring distinct treatments. Diagnosis depends critically on timely access to CT imaging to differentiate stroke type. Ischaemic strokes are treated with aspirin, statins, and in eligible cases, thrombolysis using alteplase, ideally within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. In resource-limited settings or when imaging is unavailable, cautious aspirin use may still be considered. Haemorrhagic strokes require blood pressure control and reversal of anticoagulation, often needing transfer to specialized centers. Secondary prevention includes controlling risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypercholesterolemia, alongside lifestyle changes. Rehabilitation is essential for recovery and involves early initiation, functional assessments, and potentially telehealth.

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by symptoms such as dyspnea, chest tightness, cough, and wheezing, which often vary over time and worsen at night or with triggers like exercise, allergens, or infections. Diagnosis primarily relies on spirometry showing airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC <0.7) with reversibility after bronchodilator use, or alternatively, peak expiratory flow improvement post-bronchodilator when spirometry is unavailable. Initial management includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures such as smoking cessation and trigger avoidance. Pharmacological treatment follows a stepwise approach based on severity and age, starting with low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) combined with rapid-onset long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) or short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) as needed, escalating to higher ICS doses, addition of long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and possibly biologics for severe cases. Exacerbations require prompt assessment and treatment with SABAs, systemic corticosteroids, oxygen, and careful monitoring. Personalized asthma action plans and vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19) are integral to ongoing management. Avoidance of SABA monotherapy and oral steroids as first-line treatment is emphasized. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2023 guidelines provide detailed, individualized protocols to optimize asthma control and minimize risks.

**Heart Failure Pathway**
#L2
**Definition**
#L3
- Divided into heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with
#L4
  preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)
#L5
- HFrEF and HFpEF present with similar symptoms
#L6
**Background**
#L7
- In India, burden of HF is high
#L8

  o [Estimate from 2010, 1.3-4.6 million](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3913650/#:~:text=The%20burden%20of%20HF%20in,of%20491%20600%E2%80%931.8%20million.)
#L9
  o Likely higher now
#L10
- 1 year mortality from HF in India is [23%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X17301961)
#L11
- IHD is the [leading cause of mortality](https://www.healthdata.org/india) in India
#L12
- Burden not just directly from IHD, but the sequelae of cardiac ischemia, including heart
#L13

  failure
#L14
**Links to other pathways**
#L15
- This pathway should be considered in conjunction with (mostly to be written)
#L16
  o Risk factor modification pathway
#L17
  o HTN pathway
#L18
  o Diabetes pathway
#L19
  o Chest pain pathway
#L20
  o IHD pathway
#L21
  o Others?
#L22
**Questions for contextualisation**
#L23
- How do we treat HF at CSA partner sites?
#L24
- What are the barriers to HF management in India?
#L25
  o Financial
#L26
  o Can these be overcome?
#L27
- “The best adapted solution to the problem at hand”
#L28
**Outpatient management of HFrEF**
#L29

<u>Establish diagnosis</u>

#L30
- Clinical signs suggestive of HF
#L31
- ECG may show LV hypertrophy, evidence or previous ischaemia
#L32
- Echocardiogram with LVEF < 40% consistent with HFrEF
#L33
  o This will likely require referral to nearest district hospital
#L34
  o **Echocardiogram ability of partner locations to be determined**
#L35
- Pregnant patients require pregnancy specific management – this pathway cannot be used
#L36

<u>Assessment of severity</u>

- [Drug from each of the below classes should be initiated at time of diagnosis](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063#d53151679e1)
#L62
  o Dosages and sequence of initiation in Appendix I
#L63
  o See below if specific therapies unavailable at CSA partner site
#L64
- Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
#L65
  inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)
#L66
  o ARNI: Sacubitril-Valsartan
#L67
    ▪︎ Preference for ARNI if possible – however, significant barriers due to cost
#L68
  o ACE inhibitor: Captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril
#L69
    ▪︎ Lisinopril and ramipril and once daily dosing, which may be preferable
#L70
  o ARB
#L71
    ▪︎ Candesartan, losartan, valsartan
#L72
  o The use of ARNI/ACE/ARB in patients with eGFR < 30 is not contraindicated,
#L73
    but caution should be exercised
#L74
- [**Beta blocker**](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063#d1e3406)
#L75
  o Evidence based beta-blockers: Bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol XR
#L76
- [**Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)**](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063#d1e3406)
#L77
  o Spironolactone or eplerenone
#L78
  o Monitor serum potassium, down titrate or discontinue if serum potassium elevated

#L79
  o Contraindications: eGFR < 30 or potassium > 5
#L80
- [**SGLT2 inhibitor**](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001063#d1e3406)
#L81
  o Dapagliflozin or empagliflozin
#L82
  o Contraindications: T1DM, symptomatic hypotension, frequent UTI, risk factors
#L83
    for foot amputation, eGFR < 30 (dapagliflozin), eGFR < 20 (empagliflozin)
#L84
- Monitor blood pressure and electrolytes post initiation
#L85
- Ensure SBP > 100
#L86
**Alternative treatment regimens**
#L87
- On the basis of current evidence, combination therapy with an ARNI, BB, MRA and
#L88
  SGLT2 inhibitor has the greatest mortality benefit for patients with HFrEF, and is the
#L89
  CSA preferred regimen
#L90
- However, some of these drugs may not be available at CSA partner sites, due to location
#L91
  or cost
#L92
- If the above medications are not available, the below alternative regimens can be
#L93
  considered (Appendix II)
#L94
- If ARNI unavailable
#L95
  o Replace ARNI with ACEi (e.g. ramipril) or ARB (e.g. valsartan)
#L96
- If SGLT2 unavailable
#L97
  o No comparative alternative
#L98
**Drugs to use with caution**
#L99
- Digoxin is commonly used for the treatment of heart failure in India
#L100
  o Robust evidence to support the use of digoxin in HFrEF is lacking
#L101
  o Digoxin use [does not appear to reduce mortality, but may reduce hospitalisations](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199702203360801)
#L102
  o This should be balanced against the risks of digoxin therapy (i.e. digoxin
#L103
    toxicity), and difficulty with monitoring drug levels in the rural Indian setting
#L104
- In general, we do not recommend the use of digoxin in heart failure, especially if any of
#L105
  the above therapies are available
#L106
- If digoxin is to be used (not evidence based), starting dose:
#L107
  o 0.125mg daily if eGFR ≥ 30
#L108
  o 0.125mg every second day or 0.0625mg daily if eGFR < 30, or elderly, or low
#L109
    body weight
#L110
  o Check electrolytes (particularly potassium) prior to initiation
#L111
- Exercise particular caution if digoxin used in conjunction with drugs that suppress heart
#L112
  rate (e.g. beta blockers), or increase digoxin concentration (e.g. furosemide)
#L113
- Have a high index of suspicion for digoxin toxicity (e.g. vomiting/nausea, visual
#L114
  disturbances, arrhythmias)
#L115
**Other considerations**
#L116
- Patients with recent myocardial infarction and HFrEF
#L117
  o Major studies of HFrEF have excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction
#L118
  o ACEI/ARB, beta blockers and MRAs have been shown to be beneficial in these
#L119
    patients
#L120
  o [ARNI is not superior to ACEI in](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2104508) the setting of recent myocardial infarction
#L121
  o The impact of SGLT2 in the post-MI period [still being studied](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2795765?guestAccessKey=da0dbf78-f7e9-4ad1-abdc-a1ebdd2d1ccd&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social_jamacard&utm_term=7520032259&utm_campaign=article_alert&linkId=179485921)

    between 2.7 additional years (for an 80-year-old) to 8.3 additional years (for a 55-
#L234

#L235
    to 1.4 additional years (for an 80-year-old) to 6.3 additional years (for a 55-year-

#L237
    Estimation of relative treatment effects of comprehensive disease-modifying pharmacological 
#L238
    therapy on key cardiovascular events (from Vaduganathan 2020) 
#I1
the estimated relative treatment effects of comprehensive versus conventional disease-modifying pharmacological therapy on four key cardiovascular events, presenting the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for each. The results for all measured outcomes favour comprehensive therapy, as indicated by hazard ratios and confidence intervals that are entirely below 1.0. For the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure, the hazard ratio is approximately 0.4. For cardiovascular death alone, the hazard ratio is centered around 0.6. For hospital admission for heart failure, the hazard ratio is approximately 0.35. Finally, for all-cause mortality, the hazard ratio is also around 0.6. The caption clarifies that comprehensive therapy consists of an ARNI, a β blocker, an MRA, and an SGLT2 inhibitor, whereas conventional therapy includes an ACE inhibitor or an ARB and a β blocker. The provided definitions are: ACE inhibitor for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ARB for angiotensin receptor blocker, ARNI for angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, MRA for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and SGLT2 inhibitor for sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor.

#I2
the risk reduction with combination therapy for HFrEF, presenting data across three different subgroups based on Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). For the LVEF group of 45 to 54%, combination therapy resulted in a 51% risk reduction for the combined endpoint of CV Death and HF Hospitalization, a 52% reduction for CV Death alone, and a 62% reduction for HF Hospitalization. In the LVEF group of 55 to 64%, there was a 46% risk reduction for CV Death plus HF Hospitalization and a 56% risk reduction for HF Hospitalization alone, although the benefit for CV death by itself was not statistically clear as the confidence intervals crossed 1.0. For the final group with an LVEF of ≥65%, the therapies, including switching to ARNI, adding MRA, adding SGLT2i, and combination therapy, did not show a clear benefit, as the hazard ratio confidence intervals for all three outcomes—CV Death + HF Hospitalization, CV Death, and HF Hospitalization—were wide and crossed the line of no effect. The number of patients for each therapy is also listed, such as n=1,651 for switching to ARNI in the 45-54% LVEF group and n=985 in the ≥65% LVEF group.

#I3
the impact of a combination therapy, consisting of an ARNI, MRA, and SGLT2i, on the outcome of "Time-to-First CV Death + HF Hospitalization," with the results stratified by Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). The graph shows a continuous relationship where the Hazard Ratio for the combination treatment effect increases as LVEF rises. At lower LVEF values, starting from 15%, the therapy shows a significant benefit, with a hazard ratio of approximately 0.40 and the entire 95% confidence interval falling well below the 1.00 line of no effect. As the LVEF increases, the treatment benefit diminishes, and the 95% confidence interval begins to cross the 1.00 line at an LVEF of approximately 60%. The point estimate of the hazard ratio itself continues to rise, eventually crossing 1.00 at an LVEF of around 73%, indicating that the therapeutic benefit is attenuated and lost in patients with higher ejection fractions.

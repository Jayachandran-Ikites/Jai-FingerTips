### Overview and Contextualization of Heart Failure (HF)

Heart failure is broadly categorized into two types: heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Despite differing in underlying mechanisms, both HFrEF and HFpEF manifest with similar clinical symptoms, making differentiation based on presentation alone challenging. In the Indian context, the burden of heart failure is significant. Estimates from 2010 suggest a prevalence between 1.3 to 4.6 million cases, though the current figures are likely higher. The one-year mortality rate from heart failure in India stands at 23%, highlighting the severity of the condition. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of mortality in the country, and its contribution extends beyond direct effects to include sequelae such as heart failure.
 This heart failure management pathway should be integrated with related clinical protocols including those addressing risk factor modification, hypertension (HTN), diabetes, chest pain, and ischemic heart disease (IHD), among others. Critical contextual questions include understanding how heart failure is currently managed at CSA partner sites and identifying the barriers to effective heart failure treatment in India—particularly financial constraints. The overarching goal remains to provide the best adapted solution to the problem at hand.

### Outpatient Management of Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)

The outpatient management of HFrEF begins with establishing a diagnosis through clinical signs suggestive of heart failure, supported by ECG findings that may reveal left ventricular hypertrophy or evidence of previous ischemia. A definitive diagnosis requires an echocardiogram showing a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 40%, which may necessitate referral to the nearest district hospital, depending on the echocardiographic capabilities at partner sites. Pregnant patients require pregnancy-specific management and should not be managed using this pathway.
 The severity of heart failure should be assessed using the NYHA classification system (see appendix). Concurrently, comorbid conditions should be evaluated and managed appropriately. These include ischemic heart disease (a common sequela of coronary artery disease), hypertension, diabetes, arrhythmias (particularly atrial fibrillation), valvular disease (requiring specialist referral), cardiomyopathy, anaemia, and smoking.
 For symptomatic management, diuretics such as furosemide at a dose of 20–40 mg once or twice daily can be used. It is advised to administer the drug in the morning and at midday to avoid nocturnal diuresis. Renal function should be monitored weekly, and the diuretic dose should be titrated to the minimum required to eliminate signs of fluid retention. A weighing scale may be provided to assist with monitoring.

### Disease-Modifying Management of HFrEF

For patients diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), disease-modifying treatment should begin immediately with drugs from each of the core therapeutic classes. The preferred regimen includes an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), a beta-blocker (BB), a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), and a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, as this combination has shown the greatest mortality benefit and is recommended by the CSA. Dosages and initiation sequence are detailed in Appendix I.
 Within the ARNI/ACEI/ARB class, sacubitril-valsartan (ARNI) is preferred when feasible, though its cost can be a significant barrier. Alternatives include ACE inhibitors such as captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril—lisinopril and ramipril offer the advantage of once-daily dosing—or ARBs like candesartan, losartan, and valsartan. While use in patients with an eGFR < 30 is not contraindicated, it should be approached with caution 
 Evidence-based beta-blockers include bisoprolol, carvedilol, and extended-release metoprolol. For MRA therapy, spironolactone or eplerenone may be used, with careful monitoring of serum potassium levels to down-titrate or discontinue if elevated. These are contraindicated in patients with eGFR < 30 or potassium > 5.
 SGLT2 inhibitors such as dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are effective but have contraindications including type 1 diabetes, symptomatic hypotension, frequent urinary tract infections, high risk of foot amputation, and reduced kidney function (eGFR < 30 for dapagliflozin and < 20 for empagliflozin). Blood pressure and electrolytes should be monitored after initiation, and systolic blood pressure should be above 100 mmHg.
 If certain medications are unavailable at CSA partner sites due to accessibility or cost, alternative regimens may be used. Specifically, if ARNIs are not accessible, ACE inhibitors or ARBs can be used as substitutes. However, no alternative exists for SGLT2 inhibitors if they are unavailable

### Use of Digoxin in HFrEF – Caution Advised

Digoxin is frequently used in India for managing heart failure; however, strong evidence supporting its effectiveness in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is lacking. While it may help reduce hospitalizations, it does not appear to improve mortality. This limited benefit must be weighed against the risks associated with digoxin therapy, including the potential for toxicity and the challenges of monitoring drug levels in rural settings. Therefore, the routine use of digoxin in heart failure is not recommended, especially when evidence-based treatments are available. If digoxin must be used, the starting dose should be 0.125 mg daily for patients with eGFR ≥ 30, and 0.125 mg every second day or 0.0625 mg daily for those with eGFR < 30, the elderly, or individuals with low body weight. Electrolytes, especially potassium, should be checked before starting therapy. Extra caution is required when digoxin is used alongside drugs that reduce heart rate (such as beta-blockers) or increase digoxin concentration (such as furosemide). Clinicians should maintain a high suspicion for signs of digoxin toxicity, such as nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, or arrhythmias.

### Other Considerations in the Management of HFrEF

In patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who have recently experienced a myocardial infarction (MI), it is important to note that most major HFrEF studies have excluded this population. However, clinical evidence supports the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in such patients. Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) have not shown superiority over ACEIs in the post-MI setting, and the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors during the post-MI period are still under investigation. Lifestyle modifications remain crucial and should be guided by the CSA risk factor and lifestyle modification pathway. Cardiac rehabilitation should be encouraged, with referrals made to a physiotherapist or local rehab program, and patients can also be provided with educational materials for home-based rehabilitation. Additionally, vaccinations—such as pneumococcal and influenza vaccines—should be considered as part of comprehensive heart failure care.

### Indications for Referral to Specialist Cardiology Services

Referral to specialist cardiology services should be considered in patients with heart failure who present with specific complications or treatment challenges. These include heart failure that is refractory to standard therapy, persistent hypotension, or coexisting renal failure. Patients with heart failure accompanied by atrial fibrillation, those who have experienced two or more episodes of decompensation within the past 12 months, or those with valvular or structural heart disease should also be referred. Additional indications include an inability to tolerate guideline-directed medical therapy, diagnostic uncertainty, and patients who may be candidates for device-based therapies such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators or cardiac resynchronization therapy.

### Outpatient Management of HFpEF

The diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) requires confirmation via echocardiogram. Unlike HFrEF, therapeutic options for HFpEF are limited. Once HFpEF is confirmed, the primary focus should be on managing comorbid conditions such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease risk factors, atherosclerotic disease, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, anaemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnoea. If the patient has signs of fluid overload, diuretics like furosemide 20–40 mg can be initiated and titrated to achieve euvolaemia. In cases of confirmed HFpEF, SGLT2 inhibitors should be considered as a first-line treatment. If the patient has HFpEF with elevated BNP levels, both SGLT2 inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) can be considered. Certain drugs such as ARNIs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin should generally be avoided unless prescribed for other conditions like hypertension, as none have shown improved clinical outcomes specifically in HFpEF.

### Starting and Target Doses of Pharmacotherapies for HFrEF

Under the Beta-Blockers category, Bisoprolol starts at 1.25 mg once daily with a target dose of 10 mg once daily. Carvedilol begins at 3.125 mg twice daily and should be titrated to 25 mg twice daily for individuals weighing less than 85 kg and 50 mg twice daily for those weighing 85 kg or more. Metoprolol succinate is started at 12.5–25 mg daily and increased to a target dose of 200 mg daily.
 In the ARNI (Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor) class, Sacubitril/valsartan is initiated at 24/26 mg to 49/51 mg twice daily and titrated up to 97/103 mg twice daily.
 For ACE inhibitors, Captopril begins at 6.25 mg three times daily and can be increased to 50 mg three times daily. Enalapril starts at 2.5 mg twice daily with a target of 10–20 mg twice daily. Lisinopril is initiated at 2.5–5 mg daily and titrated to 20–40 mg daily. Ramipril begins at 1.25 mg daily and increases to 10 mg daily.
 Within the ARBs (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers), Candesartan starts at 4–8 mg daily with a target of 32 mg daily. Losartan begins at 25–50 mg daily and is titrated to 150 mg daily. Valsartan is initiated at 40 mg twice daily and increased to 160 mg twice daily.
 Aldosterone antagonists include Eplerenone, which starts at 25 mg daily and increases to 50 mg daily, and Spironolactone, which is started at 12.5–25 mg daily and titrated to 25–50 mg daily. 
Lastly, in the class of SGLT2 inhibitors, both Dapagliflozin and Empagliflozin are administered at a consistent dose of 10 mg daily, with no titration required.

### Sequence of Pharmacotherapy Initiation and Monitoring in HFrEF

When initiating pharmacotherapy for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), it is essential to monitor blood pressure, electrolytes, renal function, and potassium levels. For patients starting on an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), it is important to ensure there is no history of angioedema before beginning ARNI therapy. The starting dose should be commenced and tolerability should be assessed every two weeks. If the patient tolerates the dose, defined by a systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mmHg and the absence of symptomatic hypotension, the dose can be doubled every two weeks until the target dose is reached.
 Beta-blockers should also be initiated at their starting dose and doubled every two weeks until the target dose is achieved. Only bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol have shown mortality benefits in HFrEF, and other beta-blockers should be avoided.
 Diuretics should be introduced alongside therapy to manage fluid overload. Aldosterone antagonists should be started at their initial dose and their tolerability assessed in the same manner, with potential dose doubling every two weeks. Electrolytes, potassium, and renal function should be checked 2 to 3 days after initiation, then again 7 days post-initiation, and subsequently at least every three months.
 SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, should be commenced at their standard dose without the need for titration. It is essential to confirm that the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is at least 30 ml/min for dapagliflozin and at least 20 ml/min for empagliflozin before initiation.

### Sample Treatment Regimens for HFrEF and Associated Costs

The preferred regimen for treating heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), as per recent clinical trials and the most current global guidelines, includes a combination of sacubitril/valsartan, a beta blocker such as bisoprolol, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) like spironolactone or eplerenone, and an SGLT2 inhibitor such as dapagliflozin or empagliflozin. This comprehensive regimen has an approximate annual cost of ₹77,000. 
 If sacubitril/valsartan is unavailable, often due to cost constraints, an alternative regimen involves the use of an ACE inhibitor like ramipril or an ARB such as valsartan, in addition to a beta blocker (e.g. bisoprolol), an MRA (e.g. spironolactone), and an SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g. dapagliflozin). This regimen reduces the annual cost to approximately ₹10,000.
 In cases where both sacubitril/valsartan and SGLT2 inhibitors are unavailable, again typically due to affordability, the treatment should include an ACEI (e.g. ramipril) or an ARB (e.g. valsartan), a beta blocker (e.g. bisoprolol), and an MRA (e.g. spironolactone). There are currently no alternative agents for SGLT2 inhibitors. The estimated annual cost for this limited regimen is around ₹3,000.

### CSA Sample Treatment Regimens for HFrEF

The CSA preferred treatment regimen for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) includes Sacubitril/Valsartan for RAAS inhibition, Bisoprolol as the beta blocker, Eplerenone as the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), Dapagliflozin as the SGLT2 inhibitor, and Furosemide as the diuretic. Regular monitoring of electrolytes and renal function is required.
 Alternate Regimen #1 substitutes Sacubitril/Valsartan with either Ramipril or Valsartan. Bisoprolol remains the beta blocker, and it is accompanied by Spironolactone as the MRA and Dapagliflozin as the SGLT2 inhibitor, with Furosemide included as a diuretic. Electrolytes and renal function should be routinely monitored.
 Alternate Regimen #2 also uses Ramipril or Valsartan in place of Sacubitril/Valsartan. It retains Bisoprolol and Spironolactone, but excludes any SGLT2 inhibitor. Furosemide is used as the diuretic, and ongoing monitoring of electrolytes and renal function remains necessary.
 It is noted that Bisoprolol can be replaced with Carvedilol or Metoprolol XR, while Ramipril can be substituted with another ACE inhibitor and Valsartan can be replaced with an alternative angiotensin receptor blocker.

### Key Evidence Supporting Pharmacotherapy in HFrEF

Several landmark clinical trials have established the efficacy of various pharmacological agents in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The PARADIGM study (2014), which involved 8,442 patients with NYHA Class II-IV HFrEF (EF < 40%), demonstrated that sacubitril-valsartan significantly reduced the risk of death and hospitalization compared to enalapril, when both were added to standard therapy.
 The EMPEROR-Reduced trial (2020) evaluated 3,730 patients with NYHA Class II-IV HFrEF (EF < 40%) and found that empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure versus placebo, regardless of whether patients had diabetes.
 Similarly, the DAPA-HF trial (2019), which included 4,744 patients with NYHA Class II-IV HFrEF (EF < 40%), showed that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of worsening heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes compared to placebo. 
 In the EMPHASIS study (2011), 2,737 patients with NYHA Class II HFrEF (EF < 35%) were randomized to receive eplerenone or placebo, in addition to their regular therapy. The study found that eplerenone significantly reduced the risk of death and hospitalization compared to placebo.
 Furthermore, a 2020 analysis by Vaduganathan estimated the lifetime benefits of comprehensive disease-modifying medical therapy in HFrEF. The study concluded that treatment combining ARNI, MRA, and an SGLT2 inhibitor provided superior outcomes compared to conventional therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and beta blockers. The estimated benefit ranged from 2.7 additional years of event-free survival (for an 80-year-old) to 8.3 years (for a 55-year-old) before cardiovascular death or first hospital admission, and from 1.4 to 6.3 additional years of overall survival when compared to standard therapy.

### Benefits of Comprehensive Pharmacological Therapy in HFrEF (Vaduganathan 2020)

The 2020 analysis by Vaduganathan provides strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of comprehensive disease-modifying pharmacological therapy for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This comprehensive regimen includes an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), a beta blocker, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), and a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. In contrast, conventional therapy typically consists of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combined with a beta blocker. 
 The figure from the study presents hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for several key cardiovascular outcomes. These outcomes include cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure, cardiovascular death alone, hospital admission for heart failure alone, and all-cause mortality. In each category, comprehensive therapy demonstrated superior results compared to conventional therapy. 
 Specifically, comprehensive therapy significantly lowered the risk of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure. It also reduced the individual risks of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization. Furthermore, there was a notable reduction in all-cause mortality among patients receiving comprehensive therapy. All hazard ratios were well below 1.0, indicating a clear benefit of comprehensive therapy over conventional treatment strategies.
 Overall, this analysis strongly supports the routine use of the full combination of ARNI, beta blocker, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitor in the management of HFrEF, emphasizing its role in improving survival and reducing hospital admissions.

### Risk Reduction with Combination Therapy in HFrEF Across LVEF Ranges

the impact of combination pharmacological therapy—comprising angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), and SGLT2 inhibitor—on key cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure across different left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) categories.
 In patients with LVEF between 45% and 54%, combination therapy demonstrated a 51% risk reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, a 52% reduction in cardiovascular death, and a 62% reduction in heart failure hospitalization. These results were superior to the outcomes of single interventions such as switching to ARNI, adding an MRA, or adding an SGLT2 inhibitor individually.
 Among patients with LVEF between 55% and 64%, the benefit of combination therapy persisted, with a 46% risk reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, a notable reduction in cardiovascular death, and a 56% reduction in heart failure hospitalization. Although individual therapies showed benefit, the combined approach consistently delivered superior outcomes. 
 In patients with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF ≥65%), the benefit of combination therapy was less pronounced. While the hazard ratios still favored combination treatment over individual therapies, the confidence intervals were wider and approached or crossed the line of no effect, indicating diminished statistical significance. 
 Overall, these data support the robust benefits of comprehensive combination therapy, especially in patients with mid-range to mildly reduced ejection fraction (LVEF 45–64%). The effectiveness diminishes in patients with LVEF ≥65%, suggesting that such therapy may be most impactful in those with reduced or mildly reduced ejection fraction.

### Effectiveness of Combination Therapy on Cardiovascular Outcomes in HFrEF Patients Across LVEF Spectrum

the effect of combination therapy—using ARNI, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitors—on reducing the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), based on different levels of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). 
 The treatment effect is strongest in patients with lower LVEF values, particularly below 50%, where the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization is significantly reduced. As LVEF increases beyond this level, the benefit of the therapy begins to decrease. In individuals with higher LVEF, especially those nearing or above 60%, the reduction in risk becomes smaller, and the consistency of benefit becomes less certain.
 Overall, this data supports that combination therapy with ARNI, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitors provides the most significant benefit in terms of reducing cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in patients with lower LVEF, and the impact of treatment is progressively reduced in those with higher LVEF.

### Assessment of Heart Failure Severity and Challenges to be addressed

The severity of heart failure is commonly assessed using the NYHA Functional Classification, which categorizes patients based on the degree of physical activity limitation caused by heart failure symptoms. In Class I, there is no limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea (shortness of breath). In Class II, there is a slight limitation of physical activity, although patients remain comfortable at rest. However, ordinary activity may lead to fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea. Class III indicates a marked limitation in physical activity, with patients still comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes symptoms such as fatigue, palpitations, or dyspnea. In Class IV, patients are unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure may be present even at rest, and any activity tends to worsen discomfort.
 There are several key challenges that need to be addressed to improve innovation in heart failure treatment. These include the high cost of medications used for managing heart failure and the potential to include heart failure drugs in government essential drug lists to improve accessibility. Additionally, an important area for development is the integration of point-of-care (POC) electrolyte testing into treatment pathways, which could help in timely decision-making and better clinical management.

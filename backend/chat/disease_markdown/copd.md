**Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Pathway**
#L2
**Background**
#L3
- COPD is the [number 2](https://www.healthdata.org/india) cause of mortality in India
#L4
- Obstructive lung diseases are [the 2nd most common reason](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2815%2900152-7) for presentation to primary
#L5
  care practitioners in India
#L6
- Up to [70% of COPD worldwide](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/rccm.201804-0621CI?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) may be un-diagnosed
#L7
- Smoking and environmental exposures (e.g. indoor fuel burning) are major risk factors
#L8
  for COPD
#L9
**India specific challenges to overcome**
#L10
- Diagnostic challenges
#L11
  o Spirometry access + training of providers
#L12
    ▪︎ Adequate technique required to generate meaningful flow curves for
#L13
      diagnosis
#L14
  o Diagnostic entities unique to India
#L15
    ▪︎ Non-smoker COPD (e.g. biomass fuels)
#L16
    ▪︎ [TB](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592751/)-associated [COPD/ Post TB](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/crj.12621)
#L17
    ▪︎ Occupation associated
#L18
  o In the absence of spirometry, how do we diagnose?
#L19
    ▪︎ Current standard practice in India  dx based on symptom complex
#L20
- Cost barriers
#L21
  o Inhalers are costly
#L22
- Cultural barriers
#L23
  o Stigma associated with inhaler use
#L24
  o Compliance issues with increasing number of inhalers (not necessarily India-
#L25
    specific)
#L26
- Existing practice
#L27
  o Broad use of theophylline
#L28
**Diagnosis**
#L29
- Consider COPD if history of shortness of breath/dyspnoea or chronic cough, and risk
#L30
  factors for COPD – consider duration of symptoms
#L31
- Consider and rule out differentials, including:
#L32
  o Respiratory: Asthma, bronchiectasis, TB, obliterative bronchiolitis, diffuse
#L33
    bronchiolitis (sputum and CXR)
#L34
  o Cardiac: heart failure (see CSA HF pathway)
#L35
- **Spirometry** is required for diagnosis: post-bronchodilation FEV1/FVC < 0.70
#L36
  o See spirometry instructions in Appendix
#L37
- Training staff in adequate spirometry technique will be a challenge
#L38
- CXR: not diagnostic but can rule out other causes. COPD may present with lung
#L39
  hyperinflation
#L40
- IF spirometry unavailable (all CSA sites to be given spiro)
#L41
  o In the absence of spirometry, diagnosis of COPD in India is often made based on
#L42
    symptom complex
#L43
  o Symptoms suggestive of COPD include:
#L44
  o There is significant overlap between COPD symptoms and other lung pathologies,
#L45
    including asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, etc.
#L46
  o If COPD is diagnosed based on symptoms alone, trial therapy with careful follow
#L47
    up. If no clinical improvement, diagnosis **must** be revisited
#L48
**Severity Assessment**
#L49
- COPD severity can be categorised based on symptoms (mMRC scale; see appendix)
#L50
- Frequency of exacerbations/hospitalisations for COPD
#L51
**Management of comorbidities**
#L52
- COPD specific: sarcopenia/fragility, weight loss – Promote nutrition
#L53
- Others: cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, lung cancer, mental
#L54
  health
#L55
- See CSA pathways for appropriate management
#L56
**Non-pharmacological management**
#L57
- **Smoking cessation**
#L58
  o Do we need a CSA pathway for this?
#L59
- Reduce exposure to indoor smoke/[biomass fuels](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/40/1/239)
#L60
  o Use of biomass fuels may be more prevalent in rural settings (i.e. places where
#L61
    CSA partner sites are)
#L62
  o How do we make this practical for people? This is a big structural issue
#L63
- Pulmonary rehab
#L64
  o Rehab/physiotherapy pathway TBD
#L65
  o Offer alternate occupation
#L66
  o Treat comorbidity
#L67
**Maintenance medical therapy**
#L68
- [WHO basic minimum package:](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-package-of-essential-noncommunicable-(pen)-disease-interventions-for-primary-health-care)
#L69
  o Maintenance: Salbutamol PRN +/- PO theophylline, +/- theophylline if available
#L70
  o Exacerbation: abx, pred, salbumtamol, O2
#L71
- Need costings for all the below:
#L72
- SABA
#L73
  o Salbutamol
#L74
- LABA
#L75
  o Salmeterol or Formeterol
#L76
- SAMA
#L77
  o Ipratropium
#L78
- LAMA
#L79
  o Tiotropium
#L80
- ICS
#L81
**Assess disease severity and initiate maintenance therapy**
#L82
- mMRC system (appendix)
#L83
- A – less symptomatic and low risk of exacerbation
#L84
  o PRN bronchodilator – SABA or SAMA (see formulary for options) **OR**
#L85
  o Combination SABA/SAMA
#L86
- B – more symptomatic and low risk of exacerbation
#L87
  o Regular long-acting bronchodilator (LABA or LAMA) **AND**
#L88
  o PRN SABA
#L89
- E – high risk of exacerbation (>2 moderate exacerbations or >= 1 leading to
#L90
  hospitalization)
#L91
- ICS: Can consider if 2 or more exacerbations annually and if blood eosinophils greater
#L92
  than 300

#I1
The initial pharmacological treatment for patients, who are categorized into groups based on their exacerbation history and symptoms. Patients with 0 or 1 moderate exacerbations (not leading to hospital admission) are classified as either Group A if their mMRC score is 0-1 or CAT score is less than 10, or as Group B if their mMRC is 2 or more, or CAT is 10 or more. Patients with 2 or more moderate exacerbations or at least 1 leading to hospitalization are placed in Group E. The recommended treatment for Group A is a bronchodilator, while for Group B, the treatment is a LABA + LAMA combination. Group E is also treated with LABA + LAMA, with the additional consideration of adding ICS if the blood eosinophil count (eos) is ≥ 300. An asterisk notes that single inhaler therapy may be more convenient and effective than multiple inhalers, and that exacerbations refer to the number per year. The provided definitions for abbreviations are: eos for blood eosinophil count in cells per microliter, mMRC for modified Medical Research Council dyspnea questionnaire, and CAT™ for COPD Assessment Test™.

#I2
the protocol for follow-up pharmacological treatment, beginning with the instruction to maintain treatment if the response is appropriate. If the response is not appropriate, a series of steps should be followed: check adherence, inhaler technique, and comorbidities; consider the predominant treatable trait to target (dyspnea or exacerbations), using the exacerbation pathway if both need to be targeted; place the patient in the flowchart box corresponding to their current treatment and follow the indications; and finally, assess the response, adjust, and review, noting that these recommendations are independent of the ABE assessment at diagnosis. The treatment is then split into two pathways: for Dyspnea, the patient starts on a LABA or LAMA, progresses to LABA + LAMA, and if symptoms persist, the next steps are to consider switching the inhaler device or molecules, implementing or escalating non-pharmacologic treatments, and investigating other causes of dyspnea. For Exacerbations, a patient on a LABA or LAMA can be moved to LABA + LAMA + ICS if their blood eosinophil count (eos) is ≥ 300; otherwise, they are moved to LABA + LAMA. From the LABA + LAMA stage, if exacerbations continue and blood eos are ≥ 100, the patient is moved to LABA + LAMA + ICS. If exacerbations persist on this triple therapy, further options include Roflumilast if FEV1 is < 50% and the patient has chronic bronchitis, or Azithromycin, which is preferred for former smokers. Footnotes specify that a single inhaler therapy may be more convenient and effective, that exacerbations refer to the number per year, and that de-escalation of ICS should be considered in cases of pneumonia or other considerable side-effects, with a caution that in patients with blood eos ≥ 300 cells/μl, de-escalation is more likely to be associated with the development of exacerbations.

#L93
**Ongoing management**
#L94
- COPD is a chronic disease and requires follow-up and medication titration
#L95
- A constant COPD cycle of care is required
#L96
- If patient is not improving or remains symptomatic despite initiation of medical therapy,
#L97
  consider and address:
#L98
  o Inhaler technique/non-compliance
#L99
  o COPD diagnosis – is there are more compelling differential diagnosis?
#L100
  o Exacerbation of COPD
#L101
  o Concomitant pathology
#L102
  o Need for additional inhaler
#L103
- If inappropriate response to treatment AND if inhaler technique adequate AND if
#L104
  diagnosis is still COPD, can consider additional agent:
#L105
  o If on LABA or LAMA  LAMA + LAMA
#L106
  o If on LABA + LAMA and if eosinophils > 300  LABA + LAMA + ICS
#L107
  o If on LABA + LAMA and if eosinophils > 100 and if 2+ exacerbations a year 
#L108
    LABA + LAMA + ICS
#L109
  o If on ICS and inadequate response to treatment, consider de-escalation of ICS
#L110
- How do we want to address roflumilast? Any role for azithro?
#L111
**Preventative care**
#L112
- Preventative vaccination
#L113
  o COVID (all), flu (all), pneumococcal (65+ and high risk), pertussis
#L114
**Interventions to avoid**

#L116
  o Inhalers are first line therapy – they are safer and more effective
#L117
- Do not use inhaled steroids as monotherapy in COPD

# Disease Name : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

### Diagnosis of COPD

Consider COPD if there is a history of shortness of breath or dyspnoea, or chronic cough, along with risk factors for COPD. It is important to consider the duration of symptoms. Differential diagnoses should be considered and ruled out. These include respiratory causes such as asthma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis (TB), obliterative bronchiolitis, and diffuse bronchiolitis (to be evaluated with sputum analysis and chest X-ray). Cardiac causes, such as heart failure, should also be considered . Spirometry is required for diagnosis and is defined as a post-bronchodilation FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.70. Refer to spirometry instructions in the Appendix. Training staff in proper spirometry technique may be a challenge. Chest X-ray is not diagnostic but can help rule out other causes; COPD may present with lung hyperinflation. If spirometry is unavailable , the diagnosis of COPD in India is often made based on a symptom complex. Symptoms suggestive of COPD should be assessed carefully. There is significant overlap between symptoms of COPD and other lung pathologies, including asthma, bronchiectasis, and interstitial lung disease. If COPD is diagnosed based solely on symptoms, initiate trial therapy with careful follow-up. If there is no clinical improvement, the diagnosis must be revisited.

### Severity Assessment and Management of comorbidities

COPD severity can be categorised based on symptoms using the mMRC scale that is The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale is used to assess the degree of breathlessness experienced by individuals with COPD. Grade 0 indicates that the person only gets breathless with strenuous exercise. In Grade 1, the individual experiences shortness of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill. Grade 2 is characterised by walking slower than people of the same age on level ground due to breathlessness, or the need to stop for breath when walking at their own pace. At Grade 3, the person stops for breath after walking approximately 100 metres or after a few minutes on level ground. Grade 4 represents the most severe level of breathlessness, where the person is too breathless to leave the house or becomes breathless while dressing or undressing. and by evaluating the frequency of exacerbations or hospitalisations for COPD. Management of comorbidities is also important. COPD-specific comorbidities include sarcopenia or fragility and weight loss, for which promoting nutrition is necessary. Other comorbidities to manage include cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, lung cancer, and mental health conditions.

### Background and India-Specific Challenges

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the second leading cause of mortality in India and represents one of the most common reasons for patients to seek care from primary healthcare providers. Despite its high burden, up to 70% of COPD cases worldwide may remain undiagnosed. In India, key risk factors include smoking and environmental exposures such as indoor air pollution from biomass fuel burning. However, the Indian context presents several unique challenges in the diagnosis and management of COPD. 
 Diagnostic barriers are prominent, particularly limited access to spirometry and inadequate training among providers to perform and interpret the test accurately. Moreover, India encounters distinctive diagnostic scenarios such as non-smoker COPD resulting from biomass exposure, post-tuberculosis COPD, and occupation-associated lung disease. In the absence of spirometry, diagnosis often relies on symptom complexes, which may lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. Cost also serves as a significant barrier, with inhaler therapy being expensive for many patients. Cultural factors contribute to treatment noncompliance, including stigma around inhaler use and confusion stemming from multiple prescribed inhalers. Additionally, current practices often rely heavily on the use of theophylline, despite it being less effective and carrying more side effects compared to inhaled therapies.

### Non-Pharmacological Management and Maintenance Medical Therapy

Effective COPD care includes essential non-pharmacological interventions. Smoking cessation remains a cornerstone of management, and the feasibility of developing a dedicated CSA pathway for this purpose could be explored. Reducing exposure to indoor smoke, particularly from biomass fuels, is especially relevant in rural areas where such exposure is common. Addressing this issue requires systemic and structural solutions that are both affordable and practical for affected populations. Pulmonary rehabilitation, including physiotherapy and possibly transitioning patients to less physically demanding occupations, is another important aspect, though a formal rehab pathway is yet to be developed. Additionally, it is important to actively manage comorbidities that often coexist with COPD.
 The WHO-recommended basic minimum package for COPD includes salbutamol as needed and, where available, oral theophylline for maintenance. During exacerbations, treatment involves antibiotics, oral steroids, salbutamol, and supplemental oxygen if required. There is a need for cost analysis of commonly used inhaled medications to ensure accessibility for patients. These include short-acting beta agonists (SABA) like salbutamol; long-acting beta agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol or formoterol; short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) like ipratropium; and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), which are important for long-term symptom control.

### Assessment of Disease Severity and Initiation of Maintenance Therapy

The Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale can be used to assess symptom burden and classify patients to guide maintenance therapy for COPD. Patients who are less symptomatic and at low risk of exacerbation (Group A) can be managed with as-needed bronchodilator therapy, such as a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) or a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA), either individually or in combination. More symptomatic patients with low exacerbation risk (Group B) should be started on a regular long-acting bronchodilator, either a LABA or a LAMA, along with a PRN SABA for symptom relief. Those at high risk of exacerbation (Group E), defined as having two or more moderate exacerbations annually or at least one requiring hospitalization, may benefit from inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). ICS use should be considered particularly in those with blood eosinophil counts above 300 cells/µL.

### Ongoing Management of COPD

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) requires continuous care and regular follow-up, as it is a long-term condition. Management involves not only the initiation of appropriate therapy but also ongoing assessment and medication adjustment. If a patient shows inadequate improvement or continues to be symptomatic despite medical therapy, several factors should be evaluated. These include inhaler technique and adherence, reassessment of the COPD diagnosis to rule out other possible conditions, evaluation for exacerbation or co-existing pathologies, and the potential need for an additional inhaler.
 In cases where the response to treatment is suboptimal and the inhaler technique is confirmed to be correct, and if the diagnosis of COPD remains appropriate, the addition of further agents may be considered. Patients on a single LABA or LAMA may be stepped up to combination LABA + LAMA therapy. If already on LABA + LAMA and the blood eosinophil count is over 300 cells/µL, the addition of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) can be considered. Similarly, if eosinophil counts are above 100 and the patient experiences two or more exacerbations per year, triple therapy with LABA + LAMA + ICS may be warranted. If a patient is on ICS and does not respond adequately, de-escalation of ICS should be considered.

### Preventative Care ,Interventions to avoid ,Indications for home oxygen therapy and Management of Advanced COPD

Preventative care is a key component of COPD management. Vaccinations play a crucial role in reducing the risk of respiratory infections that can exacerbate COPD. All individuals with COPD should receive vaccinations for COVID-19 and influenza. Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for those aged 65 and above or individuals considered high-risk. Additionally, pertussis vaccination is advised to reduce preventable respiratory complications.
 Certain interventions should be avoided in the routine management of COPD. Methylxanthines, such as theophylline, should not be used regularly as they are less safe and less effective compared to inhalers, which remain the first-line therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids should not be used as monotherapy, and mucolytic agents have not shown effectiveness in treating COPD. The use of long-term oral steroids is also discouraged due to potential adverse effects. 
For patients with advanced COPD, referral to a specialist may be necessary. Advanced management can include supplemental oxygen, procedural interventions, and palliative care. Home oxygen therapy, which has become more feasible since the COVID-19 pandemic, is indicated for patients with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO₂) of ≤55 mmHg or oxygen saturation (SaO₂) of ≤88%. In patients with cor pulmonale, oxygen therapy is indicated if PaO₂ is ≤59 mmHg or SaO₂ is ≤89%, along with other findings such as electrocardiogram (EKG) evidence of P pulmonale, hematocrit above 55%, or clinical signs of right heart failure.

### Management of COPD Exacerbations

The management of a COPD exacerbation begins with assessing the patient’s clinical stability. Patients who are unstable or show signs of airway compromise should be promptly transferred to a higher-level facility. Key symptoms indicating an exacerbation include a noticeable increase in the frequency or severity of cough, a change in the character or volume of sputum, and worsening shortness of breath. It is important to consider alternative diagnoses such as community-acquired pneumonia, COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, or sepsis, which can present with similar clinical features.
 Airway management includes the provision of supplemental oxygen for hypoxic patients, with oxygen levels titrated to maintain a target SpO₂ of 88–92%. Depending on the severity of respiratory compromise and available expertise, non-invasive ventilation or intubation may be required. For patients managed in a hospital setting, investigations may include arterial blood gas (if available and clinically meaningful), chest X-ray, ECG, serum electrolytes, complete blood count, and COVID-19 testing. These investigations help differentiate between exacerbation and other potential causes of acute deterioration. 
Determining whether outpatient or inpatient management is appropriate depends on clinical judgement. Initial outpatient therapy includes regular administration of short-acting beta agonists (SABA) and/or short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) via spacer, along with a five-day course of prednisone at 40 mg daily. Antibiotic therapy should be considered when two or more of the following are present: increased dyspnoea, increased sputum volume, or purulent sputum. Recommended antibiotic options include azithromycin, a second or third-generation cephalosporin, or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Ciprofloxacin may be considered for suspected Pseudomonas coverage, though caution is advised due to its relevance in tuberculosis management. For elderly patients and those with diabetes, amoxicillin remains a preferred option.

### Initial Pharmacological Treatment

The image outlines the initial pharmacological treatment for COPD based on patient grouping. Patients with ≥ 2 moderate exacerbations or ≥ 1 leading to hospitalization are classified under a pathway leading to LABA + LAMA*, with a consideration to add ICS if blood eosinophils are ≥ 300. This is labeled as GROUP E. Patients with 0 or 1 moderate exacerbation (not leading to hospital admission) are further categorized by their symptom burden. Those with an mMRC grade of 0-1 and a CAT score <10 are in GROUP A and are recommended to receive A bronchodilator. Patients with an mMRC grade ≥ 2 and a CAT score ≥ 10, also with 0 or 1 moderate exacerbation, are in GROUP B and are recommended to receive LABA + LAMA*. A footnote clarifies that *single inhaler therapy may be more convenient and effective than multiple inhalers, and that Exacerbations refers to the number of exacerbations per year. Below the diagram, definitions are provided: eos: blood eosinophil count in cells per microliter; mMRC: Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea questionnaire; CAT™: COPD Assessment Test™.

### Followup Pharmacological Treatment

If the response to the initial treatment is appropriate, it should be maintained. If not, it is essential to check adherence, inhaler technique, and possible interfering comorbidities. The predominant treatable trait should be identified, particularly targeting dyspnea. The patient should be placed in the box corresponding to the current treatment and follow the indicated steps. The response should be assessed, and treatment should be adjusted and reviewed accordingly. These recommendations do not depend on the ABE assessment at diagnosis. For dyspnea, the initial treatment begins with either a LABA or LAMA, progressing to a combination of LABA + LAMA. Further management may include switching the inhaler device or molecules, implementing or escalating non-pharmacologic treatments, and investigating and treating other causes of dyspnea. Single inhaler therapy may be more convenient and effective than multiple inhalers.
 For patients experiencing exacerbations, treatment may begin with either a LABA (long-acting beta-agonist) or a LAMA (long-acting muscarinic antagonist). If the patient’s blood eosinophil count is less than 300 cells/µL, the next step is the combination of LABA + LAMA. If blood eosinophils are greater than or equal to 300 cells/µL, or if the count is at least 100 with ongoing exacerbations despite LABA + LAMA therapy, escalation to triple therapy with LABA + LAMA + ICS (inhaled corticosteroid) is recommended. Further therapeutic options include adding Roflumilast for patients with FEV₁ less than 50% and chronic bronchitis, or Azithromycin, particularly for former smokers.

### Assessment of Breathlessness Using the mMRC Grading System

The Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) system is a grading scale used to assess the severity of breathlessness. It ranges from Grade 0 to Grade 4. In Grade 0, individuals experience breathlessness only during strenuous exercise. Grade 1 indicates shortness of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill. In Grade 2, individuals walk slower than others of the same age on level ground due to breathlessness or need to stop for breath when walking at their own pace. Grade 3 is characterized by the need to stop for breath after walking about 100 meters or a few minutes on level ground. At Grade 4, individuals are too breathless to leave the house or become breathless while dressing or undressing. This scale is useful for evaluating the functional impact of breathlessness on daily life.

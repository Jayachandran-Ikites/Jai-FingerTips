# Disease Name : Pneumonia

### Initial Assessment

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.
 The initial assessment of the patient with pneumoina should begin with evaluating their stability. If the patient is unstable, resuscitate them immediately and consider transferring to a higher level of care. And if stable then  Differential diagnoses should be considered early in the evaluation. Pulse oximetry should be obtained as part of the initial workup. Now next step is to figure out if a person is consistent with CAP through readiography of chest

### Radiography for CAP

When considering radiography for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), chest X-rays are not always necessary. If the patient has a clinical presentation consistent with CAP, is suitable for outpatient treatment, and has no severe disease, relevant comorbidities, hypoxia, or diagnostic uncertainty, then radiography may be skipped. However, if the patient is unwell, clinically unstable, or there is doubt in diagnosis, a chest X-ray should be obtained. Although we prefer all patients to receive a chest X-ray, resource limitations may require relying on clinical judgment alone. AFter chest radiography do differential diagnosis and figure out the location of treatement

### Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating a patient with suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), a differential diagnosis should be considered. All such patients should be screened for COVID-19. During flu season, also consider screening for influenza A and B. If tuberculosis is suspected, follow local protocols or the CSA pathway. Screening for these conditions typically represents the first laboratory step in assessing suspected CAP. If there is no clinical or radiologic evidence of CAP, alternative diagnoses should be explored.

### Location of Treatment

Deciding the location of treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) depends on risk stratification and clinical judgment. Tools like CRB-65, CURB-65, and PSI can help assess the severity. CRB-65 is the simplest, requiring no blood tests. CURB-65 includes confusion, urea >7 mmol/L, respiratory rate >=30, blood pressure <90 systolic or <=60 diastolic, and age >=65. A score of 0-1 suggests outpatient treatment, 2 suggests short hospitalization or close outpatient monitoring, while 3 or more indicates the need for inpatient or ICU care. CRB-65 score of 0 (low risk) suggests outpatient care. Score of 1 (mild risk) also supports outpatient care. Score of 2 (moderate risk) suggests hospital admission. Scores of 3-4 (high risk) indicate severe pneumonia and need for inpatient treatment, possibly ICU care.

### Outpatient Treatment for CAP (No Risk Factors)

For outpatient treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients without risk factors, initiate empiric antibiotic therapy for 5 days using a first-line oral agent. Recommended treatment options include: Amoxicillin 1g three times daily OR Doxycycline 100mg twice daily OR Azithromycin 500mg on day one, then 250mg daily thereafter OR Clarithromycin 500mg twice daily.

### Outpatient Treatment for CAP (Comorbidities or Recent Antibiotic Use)

For outpatient treatment of CAP in patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic use, treat for 5 days. The treatment should include Amoxicillin/Clavulanate 875/125mg twice daily OR Cefuroxime 500mg twice daily, along with Doxycycline 100mg twice daily OR Azithromycin 500mg on day one, then 250mg daily thereafter OR Clarithromycin 500mg twice daily.

### Interventions to Avoid for Outpatient

In the outpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), certain interventions and tests are not routinely necessary. Patients with suspected CAP who are suitable for outpatient care do not require sputum culture, blood culture, urinary antigens, or inflammatory markers such as CRP and procalcitonin. These tests should only be considered in patients with severe CAP requiring inpatient treatment or those with significant co-morbidities. Antibiotic treatment should not include empiric use of carbapenems like meropenem or imipenem, as these offer unnecessarily broad-spectrum coverage for typical CAP pathogens. Similarly, avoid using anti-MRSA or anti-pseudomonal agents empirically, since these organisms are not common causes of CAP. Corticosteroids should also not be prescribed for CAP in outpatient settings, as clinical trials have not demonstrated any clear benefit—except potentially in cases of severe CAP, as indicated in the CAPECOD trial.

### ATS/IDSA Criteria for ICU Admission

To determine whether ICU admission is required for a patient with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), perform an initial check for signs of severe disease. Look for evidence of septic shock or respiratory failure. According to ATS/IDSA guidelines, ICU admission should then be considered using major and minor criteria. Major criteria include septic shock requiring vasopressors and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Minor criteria include respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute, PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 250, multilobar infiltrates, confusion or disorientation, uremia (BUN ≥ 20 mg/dL), leukopenia (WBC < 4,000/μL), thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100,000/μL), hypothermia, and hypotension.

### ICU Management

When ICU management is required and , admit the patient to the ICU, which may involve transfer to a district or teaching hospital. Begin antibiotic therapy before transfer. Empiric treatment for severe community-acquired pneumonia includes Ceftriaxone 1-2g daily AND either Azithromycin 500mg daily OR Clarithromycin 500mg twice daily. For microbiological testing in severe CAP, obtain both blood and sputum cultures to guide further management.

### Inpatient Management

For inpatient Management when ICU is not required but the patient needs inpatient care for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), initiate intravenous empiric antibiotic therapy for 5 days. The recommended treatment is Ceftriaxone 1-2g daily AND Azithromycin 500mg daily OR Clarithromycin 500mg twice daily. If the patient requires transfer to another facility, ensure the first dose of antibiotics is administered before transfer. Also, check for any prior history of respiratory MRSA, respiratory Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or if MRSA or Pseudomonas is suspected based on the patient's condition (e.g. underlying structural lung disease) or relevant epidemiological factors.

### Management of Suspected or Confirmed MRSA and Pseudomonas in CAP

In patients with a prior history of respiratory MRSA, add Vancomycin IV (15mg/kg every 12 hours) and obtain cultures or PCR to guide ongoing therapy. Vancomycin or MRSA coverage should be stopped if MRSA is not identified on laboratory testing. In patients with a prior history of respiratory Pseudomonas aeruginosa, initiate treatment with antipseudomonal coverage such as piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g every 6 hours or cefepime 2g three times daily. Cultures or PCR should be obtained to guide therapy, and pseudomonal coverage should be discontinued if pseudomonas is not identified. If MRSA or pseudomonas is suspected based on the patient's condition (e.g., underlying structural lung disease) or epidemiological factors, management depends on severity. In non-severe disease, obtain cultures or PCR but withhold MRSA or pseudomonas coverage unless confirmed. In severe disease, initiate MRSA or pseudomonas coverage and obtain cultures or PCR to guide continued treatment. Avoid respiratory fluoroquinolones unless tuberculosis (TB) has been ruled out.

### Ongoing Inpatient and outpatient Management

The clinician should ensure that patients receiving ongoing inpatient management for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are treated with antibiotics for a minimum of 5 days. The clinician may de-escalate empiric antibiotic therapy as the patient shows clinical improvement. If the patient does not improve on empiric therapy, the clinician should reassess the case to consider the possibility of resistant organisms such as MRSA or Pseudomonas, complications of CAP such as empyema or parapneumonic effusion, or an alternative diagnosis.
 For the ongoing management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in an outpatient setting, it is important to ensure that the patient has been afebrile for more than 48 hours and is clinically stable before stopping antibiotics. A follow-up should be arranged within 48 to 72 hours to assess the patient’s response to treatment and overall stability. Additionally, a further follow-up should be scheduled in 4 to 6 weeks to determine whether the patient requires catch-up vaccination for COVID-19, influenza, or pneumococcal disease.

### Plan for Discharge

The clinician should arrange appropriate follow-up with the patient prior to discharge after inpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This includes scheduling a follow-up visit in 48-72 hours to assess treatment response and clinical stability. Additionally, a second follow-up should be arranged in 4-6 weeks to determine whether the patient requires catch-up vaccinations for COVID-19, influenza, or pneumococcus.

### Management of Influenza-Positive CAP

In patients who test positive for influenza, if they are within 3 days of symptom onset, the clinician should initiate treatment with oseltamivir 75mg twice daily for 5 days. The clinician should also cover with empirical antibiotics due to the risk of bacterial superinfection or co-infection.

### Chest X-ray is not available and Indications for chest X-ray

If a chest X-ray is not available, it is important to note that ideally, suspected pneumonia should be investigated with a chest X-ray. However, a provisional clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can be made in patients who present with a clinical picture consistent with CAP, are suitable for outpatient management, have no compelling alternative diagnoses, no relevant co-morbidities, and show no signs of hypoxia or severe disease. In cases where a chest X-ray is not available on-site, it should be obtained for patients who are unwell, clinically unstable, have evidence of severe disease or hypoxia, have relevant co-morbidities, or when there is diagnostic uncertainty.

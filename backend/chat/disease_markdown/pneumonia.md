**This pathway is suitable for**
#L13
- Adults presenting to CSA clinics
#L14
**Initial assessment**
#L15
- Assess stability
#L16
  o If unstable, resuscitate +/- transfer to higher level of care
#L17
- Consider differential diagnoses
#L18
- Obtain pulse oximetry
#L19
**Radiography for CAP**
#L20
- Routine chest radiography is not required for patients who have:
#L21
  o A clinical presentation consistent with CAP **AND**
#L22
  o Are candidates for outpatient management **AND**
#L23
  o No compelling differential diagnoses **AND**
#L24
  o No relevant co-morbidities **AND**
#L25
  o No hypoxia/evidence of severe disease **AND**
#L26
  o NB: our preference is for all patients to have CXR if possible. However,
#L27
    infrastructure limitations can prohibit this. In the case CXR is not available,
#L28
    careful clinical diagnosis can be considered. In outpatient settings globally, [CAP](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29167296/)
#L29
    [is often diagnosed without CXR.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29167296/)
#L30
- Chest XR should be obtained for patients who are:
#L31
  o Unwell, clinically unstable, have evidence of severe disease, or hypoxic **OR**
#L32
  o If there are relevant co-morbidities **OR**
#L33
  o If there is diagnostic uncertainty
#L34
**Lab tests for CAP**
#L35
- All patients with suspected CAP should be screened for COVID-19
#L36
- During flu season, consider screening patients with suspected CAP for influenza A/B
#L37
- Patients suspected of tuberculosis should be investigated according to local
#L38
  protocols/CSA pathway (to be written)

#L39
**Location of treatment**

#L40
- Decision to manage patient as an outpatient or inpatient to be determined through risk stratification and clinical judgment

#L41
- CRB65, CURB65 and PSI can be used to stratify risk (Appendix 3)

#L42
  o CRB65 is the simplest tool and does not require blood tests

#L43
- Investigations such as arterial blood gas, full blood count, and biochemistry may aid in risk stratification (and are required by the PSI)

#L44
**IF patient suitable for outpatient management of CAP**

#L45
- i.e. clinically stable, low CRB65

#L46
- Initiate empiric therapy for CAP with first line oral agent (Appendix 1)

#L47
- Re-assess patient in 48–72 hours

#L48
- Outpatient CAP should be treated for 5 days

#L49
  o Ensure afebrile > 48 hours and clinically stable prior to stopping antibiotics

#L50
**IF patient requires inpatient management of CAP**

#L51
- Assess capacity to manage at CSA partner site

#L52
  o Arrange transfer if required

#L53
- Use the ATS/IDSA Major and Minor criteria to determine regular ward vs ICU level care (Appendix 4)

#L54
- Take sputum and blood cultures if possible (only in severe CAP, as defined in the appendix)

#L55
- Start IV empiric antibiotic therapy as soon as possible (Appendix 1)

#L56
  o If patient requires transfer, give first dose of antibiotics prior to transfer

#L57
  o If intravenous access not possible at CSA site, then IM ceftriaxone can be considered as a temporising measure

#L58
- Give antibiotics for at least 5 days

#L59
- Initial empiric therapy can be de-escalated as patient clinically improves

#L60
- If patient does not improve clinically on empiric therapy, re-assess patient and consider:

#L61
  o Resistant organisms (MRSA, Pseudomonas)

#L62
  o Complications of CAP (Parapneumonic effusion, Empyema)

#L63
  o Alternative diagnosis

#L64
**In influenza positive**

#L65
- If within 3 days of symptom onset, start oseltamivir 75mg BD for 5 days

#L66
- Cover with empirical antibiotics given the risk for bacterial superinfection/co-infection

#L67
**If Covid positive**

#L68
- As per CSA Covid pathway

#L69
**Plan for discharge**

#L70
- Follow-up should be arranged with patient prior to discharge

#L71
  o Arrange follow up in 48–72 hours to assess response and stability

#L72
  o Arrange an additional follow up in 4–6 weeks to if patient requires

#L73
  o Covid/Influenza/Pneumococcal vaccine catch-up

#L74
- Checklist for discharge (Appendix 5)

#L75
**Interventions to avoid**

#L76
- The following tests do not need to be done routinely for suspected CAP suitable for outpatient management

#L77
  o Sputum culture

#L78
  o Blood culture

#L79
  o Urinary antigens

#L80
  o Inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin)

#L81
  o These tests can be considered if severe CAP requiring inpatient management, or if patient has co-morbidities

#L82
- **Do not treat CAP empirically with carbapenems (e.g. meropenem, imipenem)**

#L83
  o Carbapenems have an unnecessarily broad spectrum of coverage for CAP

#L84
- **Do not treat CAP empirically with anti-MRSA or anti-pseudomonal agents**

#L85
  o Most CAP is not caused by MRSA or pseudomonas – these organisms do not need to be routinely covered

#L86
- **Do not prescribe steroids for CAP**

#L87
  o Multiple trials have failed to show a clinical benefit from corticosteroid administration in CAP

#L88
  o Exception – Severe CAP (CAPECOD trial)

fluroquinolones  

#L104
- **NOTES**:

#L105
    - Characteristics of penicillin allergy should be clarified prior to initiation of treatment

#L107
    do not have evidence of penicillin allergy on subsequent testing

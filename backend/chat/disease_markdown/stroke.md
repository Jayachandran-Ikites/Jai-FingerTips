**Stroke Pathway**
#L2
**Background**
#L3
- 3rd leading cause of [mortality in India](https://www.healthdata.org/india)
#L4
- [Age adjusted prevalence](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.026733): 84-262/100,000 in rural, 224-424/100,000 in urban areas
#L5
  o Lower rate in rural – is this due to higher mortality? Or inadequate ascertainment?
#L6
- Higher mortality rate in rural compared to urban settings ([28-day mortality 37.1% rural](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/strokeaha.108.531293)
#L7
  [vs 24.5% urban in one study](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/strokeaha.108.531293))
#L8
- Timely CT scan/stroke response capacity does not exist [in rural settings](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.026733)
#L9
- Very low rate of thrombolysis
#L10
  o [Approx 100 centers](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.026733) country-wide equipped for thrombolysis
#L11
- Indian National Stroke Guidelines contain reasonable recommendations, but the
#L12
  resources required to implement these are lacking
#L13
**Global standard of care for stroke (high income settings)**
#L14
- Time sensitive and resource dependent (that are difficult to implement in resource limited
#L15
  settings)
#L16
- Initial/hyperacute management is guided by CT imaging (to differentiate between
#L17
  ischaemic and haemorrhagic causes of stroke)  determines ongoing management
#L18
**Considerations for stroke care in India**
#L19
- Healthcare system capacity
#L20
  o Infrastructure required for
#L21
    ▪︎ Hyperacute stroke management
#L22
    ▪︎ Post-stroke inpatient care
#L23
    ▪︎ Ongoing stroke rehabilitation
#L24
  o Initial presentation may be delayed
#L25
    ▪︎ In a [case series of 524 stroke patients from Jaipur](http://journalsarchive.com/FILES/IJMSPH/01.AWARENESS%20OF%20STROKE%20AMONG%20STROKE%20%20%20PATIENTS.pdf), Rajasthan, the mean
#L26
      presentation time was 26 hours post-symptom onset, and the mean distance
#L27
      between place of residence and hospital was 66km
#L28
  o Only 10.5% of patients presented within 4 hours
#L29
**Management of stroke of uncertain type (SOUT)**
#L30
- [Treatment paradigm for stroke depends on aetiology](http://ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.037297)
#L31
- It is difficult to treat stroke without establishing cause
#L32
- Initiation of aspirin in first 48 hours after ischaemic acute stroke decreased risk of
#L33
  recurrent ischaemic stroke and in-hospital death compared to placebo
#L34
  o [Subgroup analysis of the IST and CAST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4933138/) studies showed no outcome difference in
#L35
    patients with haemorrhagic stroke who (inadvertently) received aspirin – but
#L36
    study not designed to assess this
#L37
- Implications: [it may be safe to give aspirin to SOUT, but this is unclear](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4933138/)
#L38
- Given the benefit seen in IST/CAST was when aspirin was initiated in first 24 hours, and
#L39
  highest risk of ICH expansion is in first 24 hours, [giving aspirin between 25 and 48 hours](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4933138/)
#L40
  [may be an option](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4933138/)
#L41
- However, these recommendations are made by physicians in high income countries
#L42
- What is the magnitude of benefit?
#L43
**Initial Workup (Hyperacute Stage)**
#L44
- Is there a CT scanner at your facility
#L45
  o If yes, continue pathway
#L46
  o If no, transfer to nearest centre with CT scanner
#L47
- Primary survey
#L48
  o Airway, breathing, circulation
#L49
  o Measure glucose (rule out hypoglycaemia)
#L50
  o Oxygen saturation
#L51
  o ECG (rule out arrhythmia)
#L52
- Lab tests
#L53
  o If available: CBC, troponin, coagulation studies
#L54
- Establish time course
#L55
  o If <4.5 hours, patient may be a candidate for **thrombolysis**
#L56
    ▪︎ INFO Box
#L57
    ▪︎ Establishing stroke onset is extremely important
#L58
    ▪︎ If stroke symptoms have been present since awakening (i.e. “wake up
#L59
      stroke”) then assume onset of symptoms was when the patient was last
#L60
      seen well
#L61
    ▪︎ Thrombolysis may be carefully considered in patients with severe stroke
#L62
      symptoms and if there is capability to deliver tissue plasminogen activator
#L63
      AND manage complications of thrombolysis
#L64
    ▪︎ N.B. there is limited thrombolysis capability in India, and the vast
#L65
      majority of patients arrive outside of the thrombolysis window
#L66
  o If >4.5 hours, patient is not a candidate for thrombolysis
#L67
- Have symptoms resolved?
#L68
  o If yes, then treat as transient ischaemic attack (TIA) vs differential diagnosis
#L69
- Assess stroke severity
#L70
  o [NIH Stroke Scale](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/715/nih-stroke-scale-score-nihss)
#L71
- It is **not** possible to differentiate between an ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke without a
#L72
  CT scan
#L73
- Is there clinical evidence of raised ICP? If yes, suspect haemorrhagic stroke
#L74
- Is CT available?
#L75
  o If yes: urgent CT brain to differentiate between ischaemic and haemorrhagic
#L76
    stroke
#L77
  o If haemorrhagic stroke:
#L78
    ▪︎ Reverse anticoagulation (if required)
#L79
    ▪︎ [**Blood pressure control:**](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000407)
#L80
      ● If SBP > 220, then immediate treatment to reduce systolic BP
#L81
        below 220mmHg. Subsequent treatment over 1-2 hours to reduce
#L82
        systolic BP to 140-160 mmHg
#L83
      ● If SBP between 150 and 220 mmHg, reduce SBP to 140 mmHg
#L84
        within 1 hour
#L85
    ▪︎ Transfer patient to higher centre for management
#L86
  o If ischaemic stroke, start aspirin (300mg), atorvastatin (80mg daily)
#L87
    ▪︎ Consider thrombolysis if available and within window
#L88
  o Is thrombolysis available?

- Alteplase dose: Infuse 0.9 mg/kg (maximum dose 90 mg) over 60 min,
#L112
  with 10% of the dose given as a bolus over 1 min.
#L113
  o Ensure BP is < 185/110 prior to alteplase
#L114
  o **Do not use streptokinase – Alteplase/tPA must be used**
#L115
- If haemorrhagic stroke, stop anticoagulation, consider transfer
#L116
- If patient is not being thrombolysed, [hypertension does not require acute](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/epub/10.1161/STR.0000000000000211)

  [management unless SBP > 220](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/epub/10.1161/STR.0000000000000211)
#L118
  o Consider need for transfer to higher centre/stroke unit (if available)
#L119
- If CT is not available:
#L120
  o Urgent transfer to nearest centre with stroke capability
#L121
  o The judicious use of aspirin in patients with stroke WITHOUT CT SCAN can be
#L122
    considered, based on subgroup analysis from major trials that suggests this may
#L123
    be safe
#L124
  o Blood pressure targets: If patient is not being thrombolysed, [hypertension does](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/epub/10.1161/STR.0000000000000211)

#L126
- Definitive investigations for stroke (likely requires transfer to higher centre)
#L127
  o CT brain + US carotids
#L128
  o If available, MRI/MR angio
#L129
  o Cardiac monitoring (exclude cardiac cause) and echocardiogram
#L130
    ▪︎ At least 24 hours of cardiac monitoring
#L131
    ▪︎ If embolic phenomenon is suspected, prolonged external telemetry (Zio
#L132
      patch/ILR). To be contextualised
#L133
- If symptoms have resolved
#L134
  o TIA is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal
#L135
    brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, **without** acute infarction
#L136
  o Start aspirin **300mg** immediately (reversibility of symptoms suggested ischaemic
#L137
    cause, as haemorrhagic progress would not expect to be reversible)
#L138
  o Consider differential diagnosis:
#L139
    ▪︎ Seizure, migraine with aura, syncope
#L140
  o Use ABCD2 score to estimate subsequent stroke risk
#L141
    ▪︎ If ABCD2 < 4, start [aspirin monotherapy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9174558/)
#L142
    ▪︎ If ABCD2 >=4, consider [dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel for 21](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30563866/)
#L143
      [days. If unavailable, aspirin monotherapy is acceptable](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30563866/)
#L144
  o Transfer to higher centre for ongoing workup
#L145
**Inpatient Care**
#L146
- To be completed at the district hospital
#L147
- [Stroke unit guidelines for India are available](about:blank)
#L148
**Prevention of recurrence/risk factor modification**
#L149
- Smoking cessation
#L150
- Exercise/diet/alcohol
#L151
- Management of co-morbidities that increase risk of stroke
#L152
  o HTN
#L153
  o Diabetes
#L154
  o Atrial fibrillation (AF)
#L155
  o Hypercholesterolaemia
#L156
- If ischaemic stroke, commence antiplatelets and statin
#L157
- If stroke due to AF, commence anticoagulation (warfarin or DOAC)
#L158
- Measure H1bA1c
#L159
**Stroke Rehabilitation and Ongoing Recovery**
#L160
- Inpatient rehab
#L161
- Functional assessment
#L162
- Spasticity/contractures
#L163
- Falls risk
#L164
- Telehealth integration
#L165
**Points for contextualisation**
#L166
- In high income settings, the majority of strokes are ischaemic in nature ([see AHA figure](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000375)
#L167
  [below](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STR.0000000000000375))
#L168
  o Approx 88% of ischaemic stroke, 10% intracerebral haemorrhage, 2%
#L169
    subarachnoid haemorrhage
#L170
- Of these ischaemic strokes, 77% are non-lacunar and 23% are lacunar 
#L171
- Is the epidemiology similar in India? Does this require further investigation? 

#I1
stroke classifications, beginning with the primary types: 88% are Ischemic Stroke, 10% are Intracerebral Hemorrhage, and 2% are Subarachnoid Hemorrhage. The Ischemic Stroke category is further subdivided, with 77% being Non-Lacunar and 23% being Lacunar, which is noted as a majority being due to small vessel disease. The Non-Lacunar Stroke classification is then broken down into four groups: Cryptogenic at 45%, Cardioembolic at 35%, Large Artery at 17%, and Other at 3%. Finally, Cryptogenic Stroke is shown to be composed of two equal halves, with 50% classified as ESUS and 50% as Non-ESUS.

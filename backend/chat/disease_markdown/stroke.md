### Challenges and Gaps in Stroke Care Delivery in India

Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality in India. The age-adjusted prevalence of stroke varies significantly between rural and urban areas, with estimates ranging from 84 to 262 per 100,000 in rural regions and from 224 to 424 per 100,000 in urban populations. The lower prevalence in rural areas may not reflect a true lower burden but could be attributed to higher mortality or insufficient diagnostic infrastructure. Supporting this concern, studies have shown that rural areas experience a higher 28-day mortality rate of 37.1% compared to 24.5% in urban areas. 
 A significant barrier to effective stroke care in rural India is the lack of timely access to CT scans and organized stroke response systems. Thrombolysis rates are exceedingly low across the country, with only approximately 100 centers equipped to administer this treatment. While the Indian National Stroke Guidelines provide sound clinical recommendations, the necessary resources to implement these guidelines are frequently unavailable in most healthcare settings. 
 Globally, the standard of stroke care—especially in high-income countries—relies on a time-sensitive, resource-intensive approach. Hyperacute management is initiated based on CT imaging to distinguish between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, which then informs the subsequent course of treatment. These practices are difficult to replicate in resource-constrained environments such as many regions in India. 
 In the Indian context, several systemic challenges affect stroke care delivery. These include insufficient healthcare infrastructure to support hyperacute interventions, inpatient management, and long-term rehabilitation services. Additionally, patients often present late to medical facilities. In one case series involving 524 stroke patients from Jaipur, Rajasthan, the average time to presentation was 26 hours after symptom onset, with an average distance of 66 kilometers between the patient’s home and the hospital. Only 10.3% of patients reached medical attention within the critical 4-hour window needed for many effective interventions.

### Considerations in the Management of Stroke of Uncertain Type (SOUT)

The appropriate management of stroke is highly dependent on determining its underlying cause, as treatment strategies differ significantly between ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes. In situations where the stroke type remains uncertain—referred to as Stroke of Uncertain Type (SOUT)—clinical decision-making becomes challenging due to the lack of definitive diagnostic clarity. 
 Evidence from large trials, such as the International Stroke Trial (IST) and the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (CAST), has demonstrated that initiating aspirin within the first 48 hours following an acute ischaemic stroke reduces the risk of recurrent ischaemic events and in-hospital mortality compared to placebo. Interestingly, subgroup analyses from these studies did not show a worse outcome in patients with haemorrhagic stroke who inadvertently received aspirin. However, it is important to note that these trials were not specifically designed to evaluate the safety of aspirin in haemorrhagic stroke patients.
 The findings suggest that it might be relatively safe to administer aspirin in SOUT cases, though definitive evidence is lacking. One potential strategy, especially relevant in settings where timely imaging is unavailable, is to delay aspirin administration until after the first 24 hours—when the risk of haemorrhagic expansion is highest—while still attempting to capture some of the early benefits seen in ischaemic stroke if administered between 25 and 48 hours.
 These recommendations primarily arise from clinical practices in high-income countries where resources for diagnosis and monitoring are readily available. Therefore, the applicability and safety of such approaches in low-resource settings remain uncertain. Further research is needed to establish the magnitude of benefit and to develop safe, pragmatic treatment pathways for patients with SOUT, especially in resource-limited healthcare systems.

### Initial Hyperacute Workup for Suspected Stroke

In the hyperacute stage of suspected stroke, rapid assessment and appropriate triage are critical for determining eligibility for time-sensitive interventions. The first step is to assess whether a CT scanner is available at the presenting facility. If so, the diagnostic pathway should proceed. If not, the patient must be urgently transferred to the nearest facility equipped with CT imaging. 
 The primary survey should be conducted immediately and includes assessing airway, breathing, and circulation. Blood glucose levels must be measured to rule out hypoglycaemia, which can mimic stroke symptoms. Oxygen saturation should be monitored, and an ECG should be performed to identify possible arrhythmias contributing to stroke. 
 If laboratory testing is available, essential tests include a complete blood count, troponin levels, and coagulation studies. Simultaneously, the clinician must establish the time course of symptom onset. If symptoms began within the last 4.5 hours, the patient may be eligible for thrombolysis. Establishing the timing of stroke onset is vital. For patients who awoke with symptoms (wake-up stroke), the time last seen well should be used as the presumed onset. Thrombolysis should only be considered in patients with severe symptoms and where the facility is capable of administering tissue plasminogen activator and managing potential complications. 
 In cases where more than 4.5 hours have passed since symptom onset, the patient is not a candidate for thrombolysis. If stroke symptoms have completely resolved by the time of assessment, the case should be treated as a possible transient ischaemic attack or an alternate diagnosis should be considered. Finally, stroke severity must be evaluated using a standardized tool such as the NIH Stroke Scale to guide further management.

### Initial Hyperacute Workup for Suspected Stroke Based on CT Availability

Differentiating between ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke without a CT scan is not possible. However, if there are clinical signs suggestive of raised intracranial pressure—such as altered consciousness, vomiting, or severe headache—a haemorrhagic stroke should be suspected. In such cases, immediate evaluation and management decisions are crucial.
 If CT imaging is available, an urgent non-contrast CT brain scan should be performed to determine the type of stroke. For haemorrhagic strokes, it is essential to reverse any anticoagulation therapy if the patient is on such medication. Blood pressure control is also critical: if systolic blood pressure (SBP) exceeds 220 mmHg, it should be lowered promptly. Subsequent BP reduction over one to two hours should aim for a target of 140–160 mmHg. If SBP is between 150 and 220 mmHg, the target should be to reduce SBP to 140 mmHg within one hour. Patients with haemorrhagic stroke should be transferred to a higher-level facility for specialized management.
 For ischaemic strokes confirmed by CT, treatment includes the initiation of aspirin (300 mg) and atorvastatin (80 mg daily). Thrombolysis may be considered if the facility is equipped and the patient is within the therapeutic window. 
 Thrombolysis is indicated for patients who have a clinical diagnosis of ischaemic stroke with measurable neurologic deficits, with symptom onset within 4.5 hours and who are aged 18 years or older. There are several contraindications, including: mild or non-disabling symptoms (NIHSS score 0–5), recent or past haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke within the last 3 months, severe or recent head trauma, recent intracranial or spinal surgery, history of intracranial haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, recent gastrointestinal bleeding or malignancy, known coagulopathy or anticoagulant use, presence of certain medications like Abciximab or IV aspirin, infective endocarditis, aortic arch dissection, and intra-axial intracranial tumors.
 If thrombolysis is deemed appropriate, the recommended dose of alteplase is 0.9 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 90 mg), administered over 60 minutes, with 10% of the total dose given as an initial bolus over one minute. Blood pressure must be less than 185/110 mmHg before administering alteplase. Streptokinase should not be used—only alteplase (tPA) is acceptable for thrombolysis. 
 In cases of haemorrhagic stroke, anticoagulation should be discontinued, and transfer to a higher-level care center should be considered. For patients not undergoing thrombolysis, acute management of hypertension is generally not required unless SBP exceeds 220 mmHg. Finally, referral to a stroke unit or higher-level care center should be evaluated for all patients, depending on the availability of specialized services.

### Stroke Management When CT Scan Is Not Immediately Available

When a CT scan is not available at the presenting facility, the patient should be urgently transferred to the nearest center equipped with stroke management capabilities. In such cases, while awaiting definitive imaging, the cautious use of aspirin may be considered. This is supported by subgroup analyses from major trials, which suggest that aspirin might be safe even when the type of stroke is not confirmed by imaging.
 If the patient is not a candidate for thrombolysis, blood pressure should not be managed acutely unless the systolic blood pressure exceeds 220 mmHg. This threshold guides when intervention for hypertension is necessary in non-thrombolysed stroke patients. 
 For definitive diagnosis and further management, a combination of imaging and cardiac investigations is typically required, which may necessitate transfer to a higher-level center. The recommended investigations include a CT scan of the brain and carotid ultrasound. If available, MRI and MR angiography may be conducted for more detailed vascular imaging. Cardiac evaluation is essential to exclude a cardioembolic source, including at least 24 hours of cardiac monitoring and an echocardiogram. In cases where an embolic cause is suspected, prolonged external cardiac telemetry using tools like a Zio patch or an implantable loop recorder may be considered, depending on context and resources.
 If the patient’s symptoms have completely resolved, the episode may be classified as a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), defined as a brief neurological dysfunction caused by focal ischemia without evidence of acute infarction. Immediate administration of aspirin 300 mg is recommended, as the reversibility of symptoms suggests an ischaemic rather than haemorrhagic origin. Clinicians should also consider differential diagnoses, such as seizures, migraines with aura, or syncope.
 To assess the patient’s risk of future stroke, the ABCD2 score should be used. If the score is below 4, aspirin monotherapy is appropriate. If the score is 4 or greater, a short course (21 days) of dual antiplatelet therapy, typically aspirin and clopidogrel, may be considered. If clopidogrel is unavailable, aspirin monotherapy is acceptable. Regardless of the initial management approach, patients should be transferred to a higher-level center for comprehensive evaluation and ongoing care.

### Inpatient Stroke Care, Secondary Prevention, and Rehabilitation

Inpatient management of stroke should ideally be conducted at a district hospital, where stroke unit guidelines tailored for India are available to guide care delivery. A central focus of inpatient care is the prevention of stroke recurrence through comprehensive risk factor modification. This includes lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation, regular physical activity, a healthy diet, and limiting alcohol consumption. It also involves the medical management of comorbidities known to increase stroke risk, including hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation (AF), and hypercholesterolaemia.
 For patients with ischaemic stroke, antiplatelet therapy and statin treatment should be initiated. In cases where stroke is attributed to AF, anticoagulation therapy with either warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is recommended. Measurement of HbA1c levels should also be conducted to evaluate long-term glucose control and guide diabetic management. 
 Stroke rehabilitation and long-term recovery planning are essential components of inpatient care. Rehabilitation should begin in the hospital setting and include functional assessment, monitoring for and managing spasticity and contractures, and evaluating falls risk. Rehabilitation efforts should also consider integrating telehealth services where feasible to support recovery and continuity of care post-discharge.
 In terms of contextualisation, high-income countries report that approximately 88% of strokes are ischaemic, 10% are due to intracerebral haemorrhage, and 2% are subarachnoid haemorrhages. Among ischaemic strokes, about 77% are non-lacunar and 23% are lacunar. Whether these epidemiological trends are consistent in India remains unclear and warrants further investigation to appropriately tailor national stroke care strategies.

### Global Stroke Epidemiology Breakdown

Globally, strokes are predominantly ischaemic in nature, accounting for approximately 88% of all cases. Intracerebral haemorrhage contributes to around 10%, while subarachnoid haemorrhage comprises the remaining 2%.
  Among ischaemic strokes, 77% are classified as non-lacunar strokes, while 23% are lacunar, with the latter primarily resulting from small vessel disease. Within the non-lacunar category, the distribution includes 45% cryptogenic strokes (strokes of undetermined origin), 35% cardioembolic strokes, 17% due to large artery disease, and 3% attributed to other causes.
 Focusing on cryptogenic strokes, they are further divided equally: 50% are embolic strokes of undetermined source (ESUS), and the remaining 50% are non-ESUS, signifying an even split within this subgroup. This hierarchical breakdown underscores the complexity of stroke classification and the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation to guide targeted management strategies.

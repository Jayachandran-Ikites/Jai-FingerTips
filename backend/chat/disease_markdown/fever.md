**Adult Undifferentiated Acute Fever Pathway**
#L2
**Definition**
#L3
● Symptoms of fever (2 consecutive temperature elevations > 38.3°C (100.9 °F) or a single
#L4
  oral temperature > 38.3°C (100.9°F) in neutropenic persons without evidence of an
#L5
  environmental cause OR a temperature elevation > 38°C for > 1 hour) for a period of 3-
#L6
  14 days
#L7
● No clear localizable symptoms to suggest immediate diagnosis
#L8
**Background**
#L9
Infectious Diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in India.
#L10
Undifferentiated acute febrile syndromes vary by season, location and may present a challenge to
#L11
the general practitioner. They are overwhelmingly caused by infectious
#L12
Fever episodes in rural tropical areas may be 4 per person per year in rural and 0.5 per person per
#L13
year in urban areas.
#L14
Early presentation may be nonspecific and overlapping for many infections and may make
#L15
distinguishing self-limited illness from more severe illness difficult.
#L16
Early recognition and appropriate specific antimicrobial therapy may lead to decreased morbidity
#L17
and mortality for some infections. However indiscriminate empiric antibiotic therapy should be
#L18
avoided in conditions where there may be limited role to avoid emergence of antimicrobial
#L19
resistance. PMID: [28356302](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28356302), 27139474, [29581252](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29581252)

#L20
**Local context**

#L21
**What causes AUFI?**

#T1
Can broadly be malarial or non-malarial.

| Infection | Areas (Epidemiology) | Seasonality (Epidemiology) | Clinical features | Diagnostic test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Malaria** | All over but higher Eastern, NE (falciparum predominant), central and South India (vivax predominant) | Higher 2 months after start of monsoon season | Paroxysmal fevers, chills, sweats. Hyperparasitemia with P falciparum can cause shock, renal failure, hemolysis | RDT<br>Malarial smear (sensitivity may be low and user dependent)<br>2nd line- malaria PCR |
| **Dengue fever** | All over and more cases in south, west | Also, in monsoon period | Fever + headache, retroorbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia | NS1 Ag and IgM/IgG |
| | NE, east. Urban->rural | | rash. Platelets <150k. Symptoms last 2-7 days. 3-7 days after initial symptoms pt can develop dengue shock or hemorrhagic fever with purpura, bleeding and hypotension. | (Sn 75-93% and Sp 88-100%).<br>Detectable 1-9 days post fever, higher in primary infection.<br>IgM band cross reacts with Chikungunya.<br>2nd line Dengue PCR or IgM capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) |
| **Typhoid/enteric fever** | All over; Urban predominance | Endemic but higher Jul-Oct, occasional food borne epidemic | Fever malaise. Diarrhea <50%. Splenomegaly. Secondary worsening in week 2. Could lead to encephalopathy and intestinal perforation | Blood cultures (pos 40-80%). Need higher volume of cultured blood |
| **Leptospirosis** | South, west and eastern India | Urban slums after flooding. a/w rodent exposure. In rural areas work in paddy fields or having pets at home | Fever, malaise, headache. Conjunctival suffusion and myalgias prominent. Jaundice, hepatitis and renal failure, pulmonary hemorrhage (5-15%) | IgM ELISA<br>2nd line microscopic agglutination test >200<br>Sn of both tests low (<50%) in first week and may be improved when tested in week 2 (PMID10586903) |
| **Scrub Typhus** | Northeast, east and south India. Majority rural, agricultural laborers | Higher in Aug to January | Fever, headache, myalgias, rash, lymph node swelling, confusion. May have eschar (22%) at site of mite bite which predates symptoms by around 7-10 days. | IgM ELISA<br>2nd line PCR or IFA |
| **Chikungunya** | All over but max KA, MH, TL, UK | Rainy season through winter. | Fever, polyarthralgia, rash, headache, conjunctivitis, back pain, nausea, rash. | IgM ELISA |
| **[Chikungunya continued]**| | | 40% can have chronic peripheral arthritis | |
| **Influenza or other viral URI** | All over | Post monsoon season and second peak in Jan-Mar | Close contact history. Fever, cough, myalgia, sore throat, headache | Flu Ag, COVID Ag on nasal or nasopharyngeal swab |

Other causes include focal infection with bacteremia e.g pyelonephritis or abdominal abscess or acute meningoencephalitis: Japanese B encephalitis, HSV encephalitis, Nipah virus disease

#L22
**Other challenges**
#L23
● Patients in many parts of India do not need to see a doctor to obtain antibiotics for fever
#L24
● Access to reliable clinical bacteriology laboratory for identification and antimicrobial
#L25
  susceptibility testing on specimens (blood cultures, urine cultures) is an important part of
#L26
  the clinical evaluation and treatment in the AUFI pathway but may be limited in low
#L27
  resource location or have an unacceptable turnaround time within the clinical context of
#L28
  such patient encounters. A follow up encounter may be necessary to make therapy
#L29
  changes based on antimicrobial susceptibility results and may not be feasible. (PMID:
#L30
  29519767)
#L31
● Burden of multidrug resistant organisms as a cause of community onset acute febrile
#L32
  illness is high and may lead to higher mortality unless antibiotic therapy is guided by
#L33
  antimicrobial susceptibility testing. (PMID 28329303; 35065702)
#L34
● Patients and clinicians may be reluctant to undergo invasive procedures including blood
#L35
  sampling due to perceptions that tests may be timely or expensive or irrelevant. The post analytical
#L36
  laboratory clinician interaction may not be timely or in person
#L37
● Prior antibiotic therapy may render a blood culture sample sterile and decrease yield.
#L38
● Cross reactivity as well as background positivity from prior infections in endemic areas
#L39
  are limitations of serologic tests used to diagnose some infections (Dengue, Leptospirosis
#L40
  and Chikungunya) and convalescent testing to confirm diagnosis may not be feasible.
#L41
  Hence clinical diagnosis should guide therapy in cases where test results are discordant to
#L42
  presentation
#L43
● In endemic areas, background seroprevalence may be high for antibody-based tests
#L44
  (example >50% Leptospira Ab in Andamans, slum dwellers or sewer workers)
#L45
● Sensitivity of serologic tests for Dengue, Leptospirosis and Scrub typhus are limiting, but
#L46
  remember the clinical suspicion may increase predictive value of a positive test.
#L47
● The Widal test for typhoid is widely used but is not recommended due to low sensitivity
#L48
  and specificity. However, if it is performed elsewhere, or is the only test available, it
#L49
  should be used in clinical decision making only for its negative predictive value which is
#L50
  around 95% even in high prevalence settings. (PMID 24995178)
#L51
● Patients may not present to CSA partner sites with mild-moderate symptoms (can present
#L52
  directly to pharmacy for antibiotics)

● Define clinical syndrome and identify clinical cues. This is guided by history and
#L70
  physical exam. A good practice is to conduct a system-based review of symptoms
#L71
  (negative history). Clinical history would include assessment for
#L72
  o Sore throat runny nose
#L73
  o ear pain, sinus pain, dental pain,
#L74
  o headache, photophobia, vomiting, altered consciousness,
#L75
  o cough, sputum, shortness of breath, wheezing

  o diarrhea (blood, mucus) and abdominal pain
#L77
  o painful urination, hematuria, flank pain
#L78
  o skin rash, ulcer
#L79
  o joint pain, swelling or bone pain
#L80
  o bleeding from mucus membranes, rash
#L81
  Physical examination would assess for
#L82
  o rapid pulse, rapid respiratory rate (exception: slow pulse in typhoid fever)
#L83
  o pallor, jaundice
#L84
  o stiff neck, photophobia
#L85
  o red throat, pus on tonsils, red bulging eardrums,

#T2
### Severity Assessment

| Parameter | Potential Cause / Association | Action / Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Temperature** – high grade fever, associated rigors | May be associated with bacteremia, abscesses, malaria, pyelonephritis or cholangitis. | Assess for dehydration esp in summer months.<br>Blood cultures have higher yield with rigors |
| **HR** –tachycardia out of proportion to fever (expect 10 beats increase per deg F rise, or 18 bts/deg C) | May be a sign of myocarditis. (COVID or viral illness) | Reassess after fluid administration/rehydration |
| **RR**- tachypnoea out of proportion to fever (Normal RR 16-24/min. Any RR above 30 /min- view with caution) | May be a sign of pneumonia or sepsis | Assess with pulse oximetry if available<br>Chest X ray if available. |
| **BP** | Low BP may be a sign of sepsis or shock/dehydration | Administration of intravenous fluids or dehydration. 30ml/kg over 30 minutes<br>Repeat bolus if severe dehydration persists/pulses remain weak<br>Then 70ml/kg over 2.5 hours<br>Reassess after fluid administration |
| **Hydration**- assess tongue/oral mucosa, skin turgor, urine output by history | Can occur due to diarrheal illness, or from nausea/vomiting, low PO intake | Administration of intravenous fluids or rehydration with ORS if due to fluid losses. 2.2 – 4 litres of ORS over 4 hours |
| **Mental status** | May be from sepsis, cerebral malaria, typhoid encephalopathy, scrub typhus, meningitis | Assess neck stiffness, need for lumbar puncture.<br>Assess for ability to protect airway<br>Assess for focal weakness, periodic breathing, directional gaze |

#L100
**Initial clinical evaluation** 
#L101
Defining the initial syndrome can be useful to narrow down the possible infectious agent. 

#L102
● Fever – Malaria, leptospirosis, dengue, typhoid, scrub typhus, other rickettsial illness,
#L103
  chikungunya, pyelonephritis
#L104
● Fever with thrombocytopenia/rash: dengue, malaria,leptospirosis,
#L105
● Fever with rash -dengue, measles, typhoid, rubella, HIV, viral illness, scrub typhus,
#L106
  meningococcal infection
#L107
● Fever with respiratory symptoms- influenza, community acquired pneumonia,
#L108
  COVID-19
#L109
● Fever with hepatorenal syndrome: falciparum malaria, leptospirosis, scrub typhus and
#L110
  hepatitis E or A with fulminant hepatic failure. Modest elevation in leptospirosis and
#L111
  malarial hepatitis. Higher in viral hepatitis.
#L112
● Fever with mental status change- meningitis, encephalitis ( HSV, Japanese B,
#L113
  enterovirus) cerebral malaria, typhoid encephalopathy, scrub typhus
#L114
**General supportive care**
#L115
● Antipyretics to control fever- paracetamol in most cases. 500-1000mg PO q8h. Max
#L116
  4g/day.
#L117
● Tepid sponging
#L118
● Assess hydration status. If able to take PO, allow for water, lime juice, kanji or ORS
#L119
  solution, especially if diarrheal symptoms or vomiting.
#L120
● IV fluids if unable to take orally, ongoing dehydration due to vomiting or diarrhea
#L121
  with severe dehydration, ileus or shock or confusion. Normal saline for most patients.
#L122
● Oxygen if respiratory symptoms and low oxygen saturation. Assess for need for
#L123
  higher level of care
#L124
● Mask for contacts if respiratory viral syndrome suspected
#L125
**Initial investigations**
#L126
● Fever with URI symptoms of duration <3 days should be managed with supportive
#L127
  care unless convincing signs of pneumonia exist or conditions like purulent tonsillitis
#L128
● Complete blood count, differential, platelet count. Leukocytosis in sepsis,
#L129
  leptospirosis. Leucopenia in Dengue, Thrombocytopenia in malaria and Dengue.
#L130
● Creatinine, liver function tests (SGPT, SGOT, bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase)
#L131
● POC glucose
#L132
● Urinalysis if urinary symptoms present. A reflex sample for urine culture should be
#L133
  drawn by clean catch midstream sample.
#L134
● Malaria rapid antigen card test [ HRP- P falciparum (high Sn and Sp)/LD antigen
#L135
  (lower Sn and high Sp)]. If available malarial smear. Negative RDT should be
#L136
  followed by smear (or repeat RDT) if suspicion high. Malaria less likely if 2 neg
#L137
  RDTs. Malarial RDTs may stay positive for >3-4 weeks in highly endemic areas.
#L138
● Dengue card test for NS1 Ag, IgM and IgG
#L139
● Influenza or COVID antigen test
#L140
**Focused work up**
#L141
● If initial RDTs are negative, and fever >3 days, enteric fever, leptospirosis and scrub
#L142
  typhus or other etiologies may need to be investigated.
#L143
● Elevated transaminases may suggest enteric fever or rickettsiosis vs other cause of AUFI
#L144
  (PMID 35491421)
#L145
● Blood cultures should be a high priority to rule out typhoid/enteric fever or other
#L146
  infections where severe presentation could be due to bacteremia. At least 20-30 ml of
#L147
  blood should be collected and inoculated in aerobic bottles. Anaerobic cultures may be
#L148
  drawn where resources exist.
#L149
● A chest X ray may reveal occult pneumonia and could be an ordered test if respiratory
#L150
  symptoms are prominent
#L151
● IgM antibodies for leptospirosis and scrub typhus could be ordered. Sensitivity of such
#L152
  tests is poor, especially earlier in illness. Microscopic agglutination test (MAT), the
#L153
  reference standard for diagnosing leptospirosis but may not be available.
#L154
● IgM ELISA for scrub typhus may be available. The indirect fluorescent Ab (IFA) is a
#L155
  mainstay but may not be available. Most common cutoff titer is 1:50
#L156
**Anti-microbial treatment of AUFI**
#L157
In non-malarial AUFI, when patient has moderate to serious severity of illness, empirical
#L158
treatment may be indicated while awaiting results of tests including blood cultures. Doxycycline
#L159
or azithromycin may be appropriate initial therapy for those who are not seriously ill and do not
#L160
need parenteral antimicrobial therapy. (PMID 24748368). Both the drugs have a comparable
#L161
efficacy against rickettsia organisms and Leptospira. Azithromycin may be a better option if
#L162
enteric fever suspected and may have lower incidence of adverse effects (PMID 17638600,
#L163
22975540, 22718054). For those needing parenteral antimicrobial therapy a combination of
#L164
ceftriaxone and doxycycline may be appropriate.
#L165
**Treatment for malaria**
#L166
● P vivax: Chloroquine X3 days [10mg/kg on day 1 (4 tabs) , 10mg/kg on day 2 (4 tabs)
#L167
  and 5 mg /kg on day 3 (2 tabs)] + primaquine 0.25 mg/kg/d (6 tabs/d) X14 days*
#L168
● P falciparum:
#L169
  o NE: Artemether-Lumefantrine [80mg/480mg (4 tabs) BID] X3 days and
#L170
    primaquine 0.75 mg/kg on day 2
#L171
  o Other states: Artesunate 200 mg X3 days + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (750
#L172
    mg/37.5 mg X1 dose) plus primaquine 0.75 mg/kg on day 2
#L173
(* Primaquine is contraindicated in infants, pregnant women and individuals with G6PD
#L174
deficiency)
#L175
**Suggested Treatment Regimens for Enteric fever**
#L176
Severe illness or inpatient care (confusion, prolonged fever, organ dysfunction)
#L177
  o Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily (50-100 mg/kg/d) for 10-14 days*
#L178
  o Cefotaxime 1-2g IV q 8h (150-200mg/kg/d) for 10-14 days*
#L179
Ambulatory care
#L180
  o Azithromycin: 1g PO daily (10-20 mg/kg/d) for 7 days
#L181
  o Cefixime 400 mg PO twice daily (20mg/kg in 2 divided doses) for 10-14 days#

#L182
Fluoroquinolones should not be used. TMP/SMX 960 mg BID may be considered if
#L183
susceptibility testing confirms no drug resistance.
#L184
(*antimicrobial susceptibility testing to rule out XDR S typhi)
#L185

**Treatment for scrub typhus**
#L198
● Doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV BID (2 mg/kg/d in 2 doses) X 7 days

● Reassess for
#L202
  o Not improving in the expected time frame
#L203
  o Getting worse in spite of appropriate treatment
#L204
  o New symptoms appear- e.g., rash, seizures, altered sensorium, jaundice, reduced

#I1
the management of a patient presenting with an acute fever of less than three weeks' duration. Initially, it requires an immediate assessment for sepsis (BP<90/60, RR>22, altered sensorium), which necessitates sepsis resuscitation. The primary diagnostic pathway then hinges on whether there are symptoms or signs of a localized infection. If yes, the flowchart branches into several detailed possibilities: for respiratory symptoms, investigations include URI-COVID and influenza antigen tests, a chest X-ray if available, CBC, and CMP. Clinical severity must be assessed, and if the patient has two or more of the following—confusion, dehydration, respiratory rate >30/min, BP<90/60, or is over age 65—they may need admission; treatment for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is Amoxicillin/Clavulanate PO or Ceftriaxone plus azithromycin/doxycycline. For a urinary tract infection, a urine analysis and culture are performed, assessing for clinical signs of pyelonephritis and for underlying comorbidities such as pregnancy, diabetes, a kidney transplant, or an elderly male with retention; empiric treatment for cystitis is TMP/SMX for 5 days or cefuroxime, while pyelonephritis is treated with Pip/Taz or Cefoperazone/sulbactam. For abdominal/pelvic issues, a pelvic exam is conducted, assessing for acute appendicitis (RLQ), cholecystitis (RUQ), and dysentery, as well as for signs of peritonitis or an acute abdomen needing urgent surgery; relevant tests include liver ultrasound, abdominal X-ray, urine analysis, and stool culture, with treatment being Pip/Taz or cefoperazone/sulbactam. For suspected meningitis, one must assess for signs of elevated ICP like confusion, weakness, or rhythmic breathing, perform a lumbar puncture to check cell count, differential, protein, glucose, and culture, and also test for HIV; treatment consists of steroids and antibiotics such as Ceftriaxone 2g BD or cefotaxime 2g QID ASAP. For cellulitis and abscess, a skin evaluation looks for an open wound, crepitus, and the need for debridement or incision/drainage, while assessing for comorbidities like diabetes, injection drug use, or vascular disease; treatment is Amoxicillin/Clavulanate PO or Ceftriaxone IV, with Vancomycin added if there is a concern for MRSA. If there are no signs of a localized infection, the next step is to determine if the patient is severely ill. If yes, the focus shifts to specific clinical clues: prior GI symptoms suggest enteric fever; the presence of an eschar with myalgias or confusion suggests scrub typhus; and conjunctival suffusion with myalgias or jaundice suggests leptospirosis or malaria. This clinical suspicion prompts a series of investigations including a CBC with differential, CMP, blood cultures, a chest X-ray, and urinalysis, as well as other specific tests like scrub typhus IgM and leptospira serology. Following this workup, empiric therapy is initiated with Ceftriaxone and doxycycline; for cases that are less severe and where there is a low concern for scrub typhus, azithromycin is the recommended treatment.Then,the diagnostic process begins with a Malarial RDT or a smear for parasites. If the malarial parasite or RDT is positive, the next step is to determine the species and parasite index, which then guides the specific treatment for malaria. If the initial malaria test is negative, the protocol calls for testing for Dengue NS1 and IgM, as well as repeating the malarial RDT or smear. If this subsequent dengue test is positive, a full dengue evaluation is initiated.

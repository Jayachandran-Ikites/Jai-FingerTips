# Disease Name : Adult undifferentiated acute fever

### Symptoms of Fever in Neutropenic Persons

Symptoms of fever (2 consecutive temperature elevations > 38.3°C (100.9 °F) or a single oral temperature > 38.3°C (100.9°F) in neutropenic persons without evidence of an environmental cause OR a temperature elevation > 38°C for > 1 hour) for a period of 3-14 days. No clear localizable symptoms to suggest immediate diagnosis.

### Managing Unstable Patients - Sepsis Resuscitation

If the patient is unstable, start sepsis resuscitation. Refer to the fluid resuscitation guidelines below. If blood pressure is below 90/60, this could be a sign of sepsis, shock, or dehydration. Start intravenous fluids: give 30 ml per kg of body weight over 30 minutes. If the patient still shows signs of severe dehydration or weak pulse, repeat the fluid bolus. Then give 70 ml per kg over 2.5 hours. Reassess the patient after giving fluids. If the respiratory rate is high (above 30 breaths per minute) and not explained by fever, it might be due to pneumonia or sepsis. Normal breathing rate is 16 to 24 per minute. If available, check oxygen levels with a pulse oximeter and get a chest X-ray.

### Physical Examination and Clinical History Assessment

If the patient is stable, perform a physical examination and assess the clinical history. The physical exam will check for: rapid pulse, fast breathing (except slow pulse in typhoid fever), pallor, jaundice, stiff neck, sensitivity to light (photophobia), red throat, pus on tonsils, bulging eardrums, sinus tenderness, decayed teeth, respiratory distress (e.g., using extra muscles to breathe, chest indrawing, grunting, nasal flaring), abnormal lung sounds like rhonchi, bronchial breathing, or pleural rub, abdominal pain, enlarged liver or spleen, masses, ascites, pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis, skin rash, ulcers, swollen and painful joints, bone pain, swelling, bleeding, petechiae, and swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Clinical history assessment would include: sore throat, runny nose, ear pain, sinus pain, dental pain, headache, sensitivity to light, vomiting, confusion, cough, sputum, shortness of breath, wheezing, diarrhea (especially with blood or mucus), abdominal pain, painful urination, blood in urine, pain in the side (flank pain), skin rash, ulcers, joint pain, swelling or bone pain, bleeding from mucous membranes, and rash.

### Symptoms Relating Infection to a Localized System

To determine if the infection is localized to one system, assess if the patient has any of the following symptoms: Respiratory symptoms, abdominal or pelvic pain, urinary tract infection symptoms, signs of meningitis, cellulitis, or abscess. If no specific localized symptoms are found, the infection may not be limited to one system.

### Treatment for Respiratory Symptoms

For patients with respiratory symptoms, signs of respiratory distress include using extra muscles to breathe, chest indrawing, grunting, nasal flaring, abnormal lung sounds like rhonchi, bronchial breathing, and pleural rub. Conditions to consider include bronchitis, pharyngitis, and mild community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). For respiratory symptoms, follow these care guidelines: test for URI-COVID and influenza, conduct a chest X-ray if available, and order a CBC and CMP. Assess clinical severity: if the patient shows two or more of the following—confusion, dehydration, respiratory rate over 30/min, blood pressure below 90/60, or age over 65—admission may be necessary. For CAP treatment, administer Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid orally or Ceftriaxone with Azithromycin/Doxycycline.

### Treatment for Abd/Pelvic Symptoms

For patients with abdominal or pelvic symptoms, signs of distress include abdominal tenderness, enlargement of the liver or spleen, masses, ascites, and pelvic pain. For care of abdomen/pelvic symptoms, perform a pelvic exam and assess for conditions like acute appendicitis (pain in the lower right abdomen), cholecystitis (pain in the upper right abdomen), or dysentery. Look for signs of peritonitis or acute abdomen, and determine if urgent surgical evaluation is needed. Recommended tests include liver ultrasound, abdominal X-ray, urine analysis, and stool culture. For treatment, administer Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Cefoperazone/Sulbactam.

### Care Guidelines for Urinary Tract Infections

For urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms, conduct a urine analysis and urine culture. Assess for clinical signs of pyelonephritis and consider underlying comorbidities such as pregnancy, diabetes, kidney transplant, or an elderly male patient with retention. For empiric treatment of cystitis, administer Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole for 5 days or Cefuroxime. For pyelonephritis, administer Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Cefoperazone/Sulbactam.

### Treatment for Meningitis

For suspected bacterial meningitis, assess for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), confusion, weakness, and abnormal breathing patterns. Perform a lumbar puncture to check cell count, differential, protein levels, glucose, and culture, and test for HIV. Treatment should begin immediately with steroids and antibiotics. Recommended antibiotics include Ceftriaxone 2g twice daily (BD) or Cefotaxime 2g four times daily (QID).

### Treatment for Cellulitis and Abscess

For cellulitis and abscess, including conditions like impetigo, erysipelas, and skin/soft tissue infections, evaluate the skin for open wounds, crepitus (a crackling sound), and the need for debridement or incision and drainage. Assess for underlying comorbidities like diabetes, injection drug use, and vascular disease. For treatment, administer Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid orally or Ceftriaxone.

### General Supportive Care

For general supportive care: use antipyretics like paracetamol to control fever, with a typical dose of 500-1000mg orally every 8 hours (maximum 4g/day). You can also use tepid sponging to reduce fever. Assess the patient's hydration status: if they can drink, allow water, lime juice, kanji, or ORS solution, especially if they have diarrhea or vomiting. If the patient cannot drink or is severely dehydrated due to vomiting or diarrhea, or has conditions like ileus, shock, or confusion, administer IV fluids, with normal saline being common for most patients. Provide oxygen if the patient shows respiratory symptoms and low oxygen levels, and assess whether they need a higher level of care. If respiratory viral syndrome is suspected, ensure the patient wears a mask to protect others.

### Initial Investigations and Empiric Therapy

For fever with upper respiratory symptoms lasting less than 3 days, manage with supportive care unless there are clear signs of pneumonia or conditions like purulent tonsillitis. Perform a complete blood count (CBC), differential, and platelet count. Look for leukocytosis in cases of sepsis or leptospirosis, leucopenia in dengue, and thrombocytopenia in malaria and dengue. Also, check creatinine levels, liver function tests (SGPT, SGOT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase), and perform a point-of-care glucose test. If urinary symptoms are present, conduct urinalysis and collect a clean catch midstream sample for urine culture. For malaria, use the rapid antigen card test (HRP-P falciparum for high sensitivity and specificity, or LD antigen for lower sensitivity and higher specificity). If available, conduct a malaria smear; if the rapid test is negative and suspicion is high, repeat the test or follow up with a smear. In highly endemic areas, malarial RDTs may stay positive for 3-4 weeks. For dengue, perform the card test for NS1 antigen, IgM, and IgG. For influenza or COVID-19, perform an antigen test. Once initial investigations are underway, start empiric therapy with Ceftriaxone and doxycycline. If there is less concern for scrub typhus, consider azithromycin.

### Focused Workup

If rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are negative and the fever has lasted more than 3 days, consider further investigation for conditions like enteric fever, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, or other causes. Elevated liver enzymes (transaminases) might indicate enteric fever or rickettsial infection, or another cause of acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI). Blood cultures are very important to rule out typhoid or other bacterial infections; at least 20–30 ml of blood should be collected and placed in aerobic bottles. Anaerobic cultures can also be considered if resources allow. A chest X-ray might help find hidden pneumonia, especially if there are respiratory symptoms. IgM antibody tests for leptospirosis and scrub typhus may be helpful, although these are less accurate early in the illness. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the gold standard for leptospirosis but may not be widely available. IgM ELISA or indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests for scrub typhus might be available in some settings. A commonly used cutoff titer for scrub typhus diagnosis is 1:50.

### Anti-microbial Treatment of AUFI

For patients with non-malarial acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) who are moderately to seriously ill, starting empirical treatment while waiting for test results, including blood cultures, may be necessary. For patients who are not seriously ill and do not require IV antibiotics, doxycycline or azithromycin are good first choices. Both are effective against rickettsial infections and Leptospira. Azithromycin may be a better choice if enteric fever is suspected, and it is also less likely to cause side effects. For patients needing IV treatment, a combination of ceftriaxone and doxycycline may be suitable.

### Treatment for Malaria

For P. vivax: Give Chloroquine for 3 days — 10 mg/kg on day 1 (usually 4 tablets), 10 mg/kg on day 2 (4 tablets), and 5 mg/kg on day 3 (2 tablets), plus Primaquine 0.25 mg/kg daily (around 6 tablets/day) for 14 days. For P. falciparum: In the North-East region, use Artemether-Lumefantrine (80mg/480mg — 4 tablets twice daily) for 3 days, with Primaquine 0.75 mg/kg on day 2. In other states, use Artesunate 200 mg daily for 3 days, a single dose of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (750 mg/37.5 mg), and Primaquine 0.75 mg/kg on day 2. *Note: Primaquine should not be used in infants, pregnant women, or people with G6PD deficiency.

### Suggested Treatment Regimens for Enteric Fever

For severe illness or inpatient care (signs like confusion, prolonged fever, or organ dysfunction): use Ceftriaxone 2g IV daily (50–100 mg/kg/day) for 10–14 days or Cefotaxime 1–2g IV every 8 hours (150–200 mg/kg/day) for 10–14 days. For ambulatory care: Azithromycin 1g orally daily (10–20 mg/kg/day) for 7 days or Cefixime 400 mg orally twice daily (20 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses) for 10–14 days. Avoid fluoroquinolones. TMP/SMX 960 mg twice daily may be considered if drug sensitivity confirms no resistance. *Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is important to rule out extensively drug-resistant (XDR) S. Typhi. #Cefixime may also be used for de-escalation from initial IV therapy, though it may lead to slower fever resolution and higher on-treatment failure rates.

### Treatment for Leptospirosis

For mild disease: Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily (2 mg/kg/day in 2 doses) for 7 days OR Azithromycin 500 mg orally daily for 3 days (or 10 mg/kg on day 1 followed by 5 mg/kg/day for 2 more days). For severe disease: use Penicillin G (1.5–3 million units IV every 6 hours), OR Ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV daily, OR Cefotaxime 1 g IV every 6 hours. *Note: Penicillin and cephalosporins lack activity against rickettsial infections and should be avoided if such infections cannot be ruled out.

### Treatment for Scrub Typhus

Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV twice daily (2 mg/kg/day in 2 doses) for 7 days OR Azithromycin 500 mg orally or IV daily for 3 days.

### Follow up activities

Reassess if: not improving in expected time frame, worsening despite appropriate treatment, or new symptoms such as rash, seizures, altered sensorium, jaundice, or reduced urine output appear. Isolate the patient from other household contacts if possible.

### Causes of Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Illness (AUFI)

Acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) can broadly be categorised as either malarial or non-malarial in origin. Among the malarial causes, malaria is prevalent across India, with higher incidence in the eastern and northeastern regions where Plasmodium falciparum is predominant, and in central and southern India where Plasmodium vivax is more common. Malaria typically occurs two months after the onset of the monsoon season. Clinically, it presents with paroxysmal fevers, chills, and sweats. In cases of P. falciparum infection, there may be hyperparasitemia that can lead to shock, renal failure, and hemolysis. Diagnosis is typically done using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), though the malarial smear may have low sensitivity and be user-dependent. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) serves as a second-line diagnostic test.
 Dengue fever is another significant cause of AUFI and is found all over India, with more frequent cases in the southern and western regions. It is also common during the monsoon period. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, and arthralgia. In the northeastern and eastern parts of India, especially in urban areas, dengue can present with a rash and platelet counts dropping below 150,000. Symptoms generally last between two to seven days. About three to seven days after the onset of symptoms, patients may develop dengue shock or hemorrhagic fever, which can include purpura, bleeding, and hypotension. Diagnosis involves detection of NS1 antigen and IgM/IgG antibodies. These tests have variable sensitivity and specificity, with IgM band cross-reactivity possible with chikungunya. The second-line diagnostic test is dengue PCR or IgM capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA).
 Typhoid or enteric fever is found throughout India with a predominance in urban areas. It is more endemic from July to October and may occasionally cause foodborne outbreaks. Patients usually present with fever and malaise, with diarrhoea occurring in less than half of cases. Splenomegaly is also common, and a secondary worsening in the second week may occur, potentially leading to encephalopathy or intestinal perforation. Diagnosis relies on blood cultures, which have a positivity rate of 40–80%, though this requires a higher volume of cultured blood.
 Leptospirosis is common in southern, western, and eastern India, especially in urban slums after flooding or in individuals exposed to rodents. In rural settings, it is associated with working in paddy fields or owning pets. The illness presents with fever, malaise, and headache, often accompanied by conjunctival suffusion and prominent myalgias. Severe cases may include jaundice, hepatitis, renal failure, or pulmonary haemorrhage in 5–15% of patients. Diagnosis involves IgM ELISA and a second-line microscopic agglutination test with titers greater than 200. The sensitivity of both tests is low (≤50%) in the first week but may improve if conducted in the second week.
 Scrub typhus is seen in the northeast, east, and south India, mostly affecting rural agricultural workers. It occurs more frequently from August to January. The clinical presentation includes fever, headache, myalgias, rash, lymphadenopathy, and confusion. An eschar, present in about 22% of patients, may appear at the site of the mite bite, typically seven to ten days before symptoms begin. Diagnosis is done using IgM ELISA or second-line tests like PCR or IFA.
 Chikungunya is widespread across India but more common in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh. It occurs primarily during the rainy season and continues through winter. Patients commonly present with fever, polyarthralgia, rash, headache, conjunctivitis, back pain, nausea, and rash. Diagnosis is confirmed using IgM ELISA.

### Challenges in the Clinical Evaluation of Acute Febrile Illness

In many parts of India, patients can access antibiotics without medical consultation, leading to inappropriate use and reduced effectiveness of diagnostic tests such as blood cultures. Reliable clinical bacteriology labs are crucial for accurate identification of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility testing; however, these facilities are often limited in low-resource settings or have turnaround times that are too long to influence acute care decisions. This may require follow-up visits that are not always feasible for patients. Additionally, multidrug-resistant organisms are a significant concern in community-acquired febrile illness and can increase mortality if therapy is not guided by susceptibility testing. There is also hesitation among patients and clinicians to pursue invasive diagnostic procedures like blood sampling due to cost concerns or perceptions of irrelevance, and even when tests are performed, post-laboratory communication may be delayed or absent. Prior antibiotic use can also compromise the yield of culture-based diagnostics by sterilizing samples. 
 Serologic tests for infections such as dengue, leptospirosis, and chikungunya face challenges including cross-reactivity, background seropositivity in endemic regions, and limited sensitivity, particularly in the early phase of illness. These limitations mean that clinical judgement should take precedence when test results are incongruent with clinical presentation. For instance, areas with high background exposure, such as the Andaman Islands or urban slums, may have more than 50% seroprevalence of Leptospira antibodies, complicating interpretation. Although widely used, the Widal test for typhoid fever is not recommended due to poor sensitivity and specificity; however, in high-prevalence areas, a negative result may still offer some utility with a negative predictive value of approximately 95%. Furthermore, many patients with mild to moderate febrile illness may bypass formal healthcare channels entirely and seek treatment directly from pharmacies, further reducing opportunities for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

### Background

Infectious diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in India, with undifferentiated acute febrile syndromes presenting a frequent challenge to general practitioners due to their seasonal and geographic variability. These syndromes are predominantly caused by infections and are particularly common in rural tropical areas, where individuals may experience up to four fever episodes per year compared to approximately 0.5 episodes in urban areas. The early clinical presentation of these illnesses is often nonspecific and overlapping across various pathogens, making it difficult to distinguish between self-limiting and potentially severe conditions. Timely recognition and targeted antimicrobial therapy can reduce morbidity and mortality in certain infections; however, indiscriminate empirical antibiotic use should be avoided in cases where the benefit is limited, in order to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance (PMID: 28356302, 27139474, 29581252).

### Initial Approach to Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Illness (AUFI):

When a patient presents with an acute fever lasting less than three weeks, the first step is to assess for signs of sepsis—such as low blood pressure (BP < 90/60 mmHg), rapid respiratory rate (>24/min), or altered mental status. If any of these are present, immediate resuscitation should be initiated.
 Next, the clinician evaluates for symptoms or signs indicating a localized infection. If such signs are present, the treatment approach depends on the system involved. For respiratory symptoms, clinicians should test for COVID-19, influenza antigen, and perform a chest X-ray if available. Blood tests like CBC and CMP help assess severity; hospital admission may be needed if criteria such as confusion, dehydration, respiratory rate >30/min, hypotension, or age >65 are met. Common treatments include Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (Amox/Clav) or Ceftriaxone with azithromycin or doxycycline.
 If urinary tract infection is suspected, urine analysis and culture are required. The presence of comorbidities such as diabetes or kidney issues can guide empirical treatment, which may include TMP/SMX, cefuroxime, fluoroquinolones, or cefoperazone-sulbactam depending on the severity and suspected site (e.g., cystitis or pyelonephritis). For abdominal or pelvic causes (e.g., appendicitis, cholecystitis), clinicians should perform a pelvic exam, order relevant imaging like ultrasound or X-rays, and manage accordingly with antibiotics like PiFla/Or or cefoperazone-sulbactam.
 Signs of meningitis such as altered consciousness, weakness, or abnormal breathing patterns warrant lumbar puncture and immediate antibiotic therapy (e.g., Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime). In cases of cellulitis or abscess, clinicians should assess the need for surgical intervention, evaluate for comorbidities, and initiate antibiotic therapy with Amox/Clav or Ceftriaxone, adding Vancomycin if MRSA is suspected.
 If no localized infection is found but the patient is severely ill, consider gastrointestinal symptoms indicating enteric fever, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, or malaria. Investigations include CBC, CMP, blood cultures, chest X-ray, urinalysis, and serologic tests for scrub typhus and leptospirosis. Empirical treatment options include Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, or azithromycin depending on severity and clinical suspicion.
 If the patient is not severely ill, symptomatic management may suffice. However, all patients should undergo a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or blood film. If positive, species identification and parasite index guide malaria treatment. If negative, dengue testing with NS1 and IgM or rapid tests should be done. Dengue-positive cases require further dengue evaluation.

#L1
**Adult Diarrhoea Pathway**
#L2
**Definition**
#L3
- Passage of loose/watery stools 3+ times in 24 hours
#L4
**Background**
#L5
- [Diarrhoeal diseases](https://www.healthdata.org/india) 4th leading cause of deaths in India overall, number 1 infectious cause
#L6
  of mortality (IHME)
#L7
- 632,000 diarrhea deaths (all ages) in 2019
#L8
- Greatest burden of diarrhoea deaths in the 70+ age group (385,000)
#L9
**Local context**
#L10
- [Antibiotics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22265057/) are [widely used](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19001680/) for acute diarrhoea in India amongst both adults and children
#L11
  o However, the majority of acute diarrhoeal syndromes [do not require treatment](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43209/9241593180.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
#L12
    with antibiotics
#L13
- Diarrhoea in adults is not as well studied as in children
#L14
**What causes acute diarrhoea?**
#L15
- Diarrhoea can be caused by viruses, bacteria, and protozoa
#L16
- Diarrhoea caused by viruses cannot be treated with antibiotics, and bacterial and
#L17
  protozoal diarrhoea often resolves without antibiotic therapy
#L18
- CSA performed a systematic review to provide further guidance in this area
#L19
  o Search conducted to identify all Indian studies published in the last 5 years
#L20
    reporting microbiological information on the aetiology of infectious diarrhoea.
#L21
    Studies had to recruit from the general population, and test for multiple
#L22
    pathogens, to reduce risk of bias
#L23
  o 10 studies were identified from 9 states of India
#L24
  o 4 studies included adults, 6 studies were limited to children only
#L25
  o The yield of pathogen detection in included studies ranged from 16.3 (examining
#L26
    parasites only) to 65.2%
#L27
  o When studies investigating parasites only excluded, yield of microbiological
#L28
    testing ranged from 25.6% to 65.2%
#L29
  o Common pathogens included viruses (rotavirus, norovirus) and bacteria (E coli,
#L30
    shigella, cholera)
#L31
**Other challenges**
#L32
- Patients in many parts of India do not need to see a doctor to obtain antibiotics for
#L33
  diarrhoea  lack of stewardship
#L34
- Patients may not present to CSA partner sites with mild-moderate diarrhoea (can present
#L35
  directly to pharmacy for antibiotics)
#L36
**Key questions to answer**
#L37
- How to test/when to test
#L38
- How to treat/when to treat
#L39
**Methods**
#L40
- UpToDate
#L41
- American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guidelines (2016)
#L42
- Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines (2017)
#L43
- Indian Council of Medical Research (2019)
#L44
- WHO (2005)
#L45
- MSF (2021)
#L46
**Proposed Pathway**
#L47
- Stable or unstable
#L48
  o If unstable, resuscitate
#L49
- Establish time course/chronicity
#L50
- Consider differential diagnoses
#L51
  o Sepsis
#L52
  o Acute abdomen
#L53
  o Malaria
#L54
  o Chronic diarrhoea/inflammatory causes
#L55
  o Treat and investigate primary diagnosis as per appropriate pathway
#L56
**Severity Assessment and Rehydration**
#L57
- Volume depletion is a major cause of morbidity and mortality from diarrhoea
#L58
- For all adult diarrhoea:
#L59
  o Assess degree of dehydration (Appendix)
#L60
    ▪︎ Mild/moderate/severe
#L61
  o If no signs/mild signs of hypovolaemia/dehydration, give ORS after each stool
#L62
  o If signs of moderate hypovolaemia/dehydration, give 2.2 – 4 litres of ORS over 4
#L63
    hours
#L64
  o If severe hypovolaemia/dehydration, will require IV fluid replacement
#L65
    ▪︎ 30ml/kg over 30 minutes
#L66
      ● Repeat bolus if severe dehydration persists/pulses remain weak
#L67
      ● Then 70ml/kg over 2.5 hours
#L68
    ▪︎ Diarrhoea with severe hypovolaemia will require inpatient management
#L69
      until patient can tolerate oral replacement
#L70
    ▪︎ ORS should be given until IV access is possible
#L71
  o In cases of severe diarrhoea, assess ability to manage at CSA partner site – may
#L72
    require transfer
#L73
  o In all, aim to replace ongoing losses as maintenance
#L74
**Anti-microbial treatment of diarrhoea**
#L75
- Most acute diarrhoea has an uncomplicated disease course and is self-resolving
#L76
- The decision to investigate (i.e. stool microbiology) and treat acute diarrhoea in difficult
#L77
  even in resource-rich settings
#L78
  o Microbiology is time consuming, can have variable yield, and not all pathogens
#L79
    identified on microbiological testing require treatment
#L80
- Indications for microbiological testing +/- antibiotic therapy
#L81
  o Signs of sepsis (see also: sepsis pathway TBD)
#L82
  o Grossly bloody stool
#L83
  o Stool with pus or mucus
#L84
  o Severe dehydration
#L85
  o Extended disease course (how many days – ICMR suggest 3 days)
#L86
- In most other cases, microbiological testing and antibiotic therapy is NOT required
#L87
**Suggested Treatment Regimens for Acute Diarrhoea**
#L88
- If required, treatment should be targeted towards suspected causative organism (see table)
#L89
- If cholera suspected:
#L90
  o 300mg Doxycycline PO once **OR**
#L91
  o Azithromycin 1g once
#L92
- If Shigella suspected/bloody diarrhoea
#L93
  o Ciprofloxacin 500mg BD for 3 days **OR**
#L94
  o Azithromycin 500mg daily for 3 days
#L95
**Follow up activities**
#L96
- If tolerating oral intake, discharge home with oral rehydration and instructions
#L97
  o Water to be boiled
#L98
  o Hand hygiene
#L99
- Isolation of patient from other household contacts if possible
#L100
- Return to CSA partner site if
#L101
  o Worsening symptoms
#L102
  o Unable to tolerate oral fluid intake
#L103
  o Development of gross blood/mucus/pus in stool

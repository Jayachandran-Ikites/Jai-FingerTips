  of the total asthma burden
#L5
- India [has 3x higher](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9149387/pdf/00528-2021.pdf) asthma mortality and 2x higher asthma morbidity compared to global

**Key points for contextualisation**
#L22
- Diagnosis
#L23
  o Diagnosis of asthma requires evidence of variable expiratory airflow obstruction
#L24
  o The gold standard approach requires access to spirometry.
#L25
- Treatment – ensuring appropriate, evidence-based stepwise treatment
#L26
- Education – including appropriate use of inhalers, literacy?
#L27
- Non-pharmacological management
#L28
- Key barriers
#L29
  o Environmental (how to address?)
#L30
  o [Financial](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2822%2900330-8) – inhalers remain expensive/unaffordable in LMICs
#L31
- Currently do not address:
#L32
  o Children 0-5
#L33
**Diagnosis**
#L34
- Intermittent dyspnoea, cough, wheeze, chest tightness
#L35
- Diagnosis requires symptoms + variable expiratory airflow obstruction
#L36
- Spirometry criteria:
#L37
  o FEV1/FVC < 0.7
#L38
  o AND reversibility (improvement in FEV1/FVC after 2-4 puffs of SABA)
#L39
    ▪︎ Various ways to define this:
#L40
    ▪︎ Increase of ≥12 percent **and** 200 mL in FEV1

#L41
  o Alternatively: 20% improvement in peak expiratory flow 15 minutes after
#L42
    bronchodilation (for LMICs)
#L43
- In high-income settings, asthma is [often overdiagnosed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28114551/), or diagnosed without diagnostic
#L44
  testing
#L45
**Differential Diagnosis (based on “cough” per [UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults-evaluation-and-diagnosis?search=asthma%20differential%20diagnosis&sectionRank=1&usage_type=default&anchor=H20489068&source=machineLearning&selectedTitle=1~150&display_rank=1#H20489068))**

● chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
#L47
● gastroesophageal reflux disease
#L48
● pneumonia
#L49
● rhinitis or rhinosinus
#L50
● post-viral tussive syndrome
#L51
● eosinophilic bronchitis
#L52
● cough induced by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
#L53
● infection with Bordetella pertussis
#L54
**Non-pharmacological management (most important)**
#L55
- Smoking cessation
#L56
- Avoid triggers

# I1
Based on the GINA 2023 guidelines for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the stepwise management of asthma involves personalized management to control symptoms and minimize future risk, centered on a cycle of Assess, Adjust, and Review for individual patient needs. Assessment includes confirming the diagnosis, checking symptom control, modifiable risk factors, comorbidities, inhaler technique, and patient preferences. Adjustment involves treating modifiable risk factors, using non-pharmacological strategies, adjusting asthma medications up or down between tracks, and providing education. Review focuses on symptoms, exacerbations, side-effects, lung function, and patient satisfaction. The guideline presents two tracks. Track 1 is the preferred controller and reliever strategy, using ICS-formoterol as the reliever to reduce exacerbations. Steps 1-2 of this track involve as-needed-only low dose ICS-formoterol. Step 3 is low dose maintenance ICS-formoterol, Step 4 is medium dose maintenance ICS-formoterol, and Step 5 involves adding on a LAMA and referring for assessment of phenotype, considering options like high dose maintenance ICS-formoterol, anti-IgE, anti-IL5/5R, anti-IL4Rα, or anti-TSLP, with the reliever for all steps being as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol. Track 2 is the alternative controller and reliever pathway, where before considering a regimen with a SABA reliever, it's checked if the patient is likely to adhere to daily controller treatment. In Track 2, Step 1 is to take ICS whenever SABA is taken. Step 2 is low dose maintenance ICS. Step 3 is low dose maintenance ICS-LABA. Step 4 is medium/high dose maintenance ICS-LABA. Step 5 involves adding on a LAMA and referring for assessment of phenotype, considering options like high dose maintenance ICS-LABA, anti-IgE, anti-IL5/5R, anti-IL4Rα, or anti-TSLP. The reliever for Track 2 is an as-needed SABA or as-needed ICS-SABA. Other controller options for Track 2 include adding LTRA or HDM SLIT, or for severe cases, adding azithromycin or LTRA, with low dose OCS as a last resort. For more details, the GINA severe asthma guide should be consulted.

#L57
**Step 1: Infrequent symptoms (<2 times/week)**
#L58
- Low dose ICS/rapid onset LABA (Track 1) OR
#L59
- SABA + ICS whenever SABA used (Track 2)
#L60
**Step 2: Symptoms or need for inhaler ≥ 2 times/week**

#L61
- Low dose ICS-formoterol as needed (Track 1) OR
#L62
- Low dose ICS daily AND SABA (Track 2)
#L63
**Step 3: symptoms on most days, nocturnal awakening due to asthma ≥ once/month, risk factors**
#L64
**for exacerbations**
#L65
- Low dose ICS-formoterol for maintenance and reliever (MART; Track 1) OR
#L66
- Low dose ICS-LABA AND SABA (Track 2)
#L67
**Step 4: severe uncontrolled asthma with ≥ of: daytime symptoms ≥ 2 times/week, nocturnal**
#L68
**awakening due to asthma, reliever needed > 2 times/week, activity limitation**
#L69
- Medium dose ICS-formoterol for maintenance and reliever (MART; Track 1) OR
#L70
- Medium Dose ICS-LABA AND SABA PRN (Track 2)
#L71
**Step 5: Consider high dose ICS-LABA and Add-on LAMA**
#L72
**Stepwise treatment of children ages 6-11**
#L73
**Step 1: Symptoms less than twice a month and no risk factors for exacerbation**
#L74
- As needed SABA
#L75
**Step 2: Symptoms or need for reliever more than twice a month but less than daily**
#L76
- Low dose ICS with as-needed SABA
#L77
**Step 3: Symptoms most days, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, especially in the context of**
#L78
**risk factors for exacerbation**
#L79
- Low dose ICS-LABA with as needed SABA OR
#L80
- Medium dose ICS with as needed SABA
#L81
**Step 4: As for Step 3, but with poor lung function**
#L82
- Medium dose ICS-LABA AND referral to specialist
#L83
**Step 5: consider high dose ICS-LABA**
#L84
**Dosage adjustments**
#L85
- Day to day adjustments
#L86
  o Reliever inhaler can be adjusted as needed (i.e. used more)
#L87
- Short term adjustments: increase in ICS dose for 1-2 weeks may be necessary (e.g. if
#L88
  viral illness, or allergen/pollution exposure)
#L89
**Stepping down therapy**
#L90
- Continue with same treatment and once good asthma control has been achieved and
#L91
  maintained for 2–3 months, consider stepping down gradually to find the patient’s lowest
#L92
  treatment that controls both symptoms and exacerbations.
#L93
**If poor response to therapy**
#L94
- Inhaler technique!!
#L95
- Confirm/reconsider diagnosis
#L96
- Assess risk factors and comorbidities
#L97
- Consider stepping up treatment
#L98
**Management of exacerbations- location of management based on extent of exacerbation.**
#L99
**Home therapy**
#L100
- All patients should be provided an asthma action plan
#L101
- Home therapy of exacerbations depends on whether we are doing Step 1 or Step 2
#L102
- Increase reliever for acute exacerbation
#L103
  o If usual reliever is ICS-LABA, increase frequency not exceeding maximum daily
#L104
    dosage of inhaler
#L105
  o If usual reliever is SABA, then increase frequency
#L106
- Increase preventer to prevent future exacerbations
#L107
  o If usual preventer is ICS-formoterol, continue maintenance ICS-formoterol AND
#L108
    increase reliever ICS-formoterol as required
#L109
  o If usual preventer is ICS with SABA as reliever, quadruple ICS dose
#L110
Above changes should be continued for 1-2 weeks
#L111
- If peak flow is < 60% of previous best peak flow, OR if not improving after 48 hours
#L112
  o Continue reliever and preventer
#L113
  o Add prednisone 40-50mg
#L114
  o **Contact doctor**
#L115
**Clinic management**
#L116
- Assess clinical stability
#L117
  o If severe: If unable to talk in full sentences, respiratory rate > 30, accessory
#L118
    muscle use, HR > 120, SpO2 on air < 90%, peak flow < 50%
#L119
    ▪︎ Transfer to higher center of care
#L120
    ▪︎ In the interim, give SABA, ipratropium bromide, O2, systemic
#L121
      corticosteroid
#L122
  o If mild or moderate: talks in phrases, prefers sitting to lying down, not agitated,
#L123
    respiratory rate increased from baseline, accessory muscles not used, pulse 100-
#L124
    120 beats per minute, O2 saturation on air 90-95%, peak flow >50% predicted or
#L125
    best
#L126
    ▪︎ Treat at clinic
#L127
    ▪︎ Salbutamol 4-10 puffs via spacer, every 20 minutes for 1 hour
#L128
    ▪︎ Prednisolone 40-50mg (adults), children 1-2mg/kg max 40mg
#L129
    ▪︎ O2 therapy if available: target SpO2 93-95% (children 94-98%)
#L130
    ▪︎ Reassess at 1 hour
#L131
      ● If worsening, requires transfer to higher center of care
#L132
      ● If improving, discharge, signs of improvement below
#L133
        o Improving symptoms, no SABA requirement
#L134
        o Peak flow 60-80% of predicted or personal best
#L135
        o SpO2 > 94% on room air
#L136
        o Safe discharge destination

#L137
        o Ensure has home action plan
#L138
            ▪︎ Prednisolone – to be continued for 5-7 days
#L139
                (adults), 3-5 days (children)
#L140
            ▪︎ Follow up within 2-7 days (adults), 1-2 days
#L141
                (children)
#L142
            ▪︎ continue the rescue inhaler as needed. rescue inhaler
#L143
                may be SABA, low dose ICS-LABA, or ICS-SABA
#L144
            ▪︎ up titrate maintenance inhaler- ICS-LABA – to be
#L145
                continued or uptitrated
#L146
**Asthma-COPD overlap**
#L147
- Both are obstructive conditions with overlapping diagnostic criteria
#L148
- Some patients may have features of both conditions
#L149
  o Particularly if long standing asthma and risk factors for COPD (e.g. smoking)
#L150
- For patients with features of both asthma and COPD, treat as asthma with ICS
#L151
  o First line therapy for COPD (i.e. LAMA or LABA without ICS) is not appropriate
#L152
    for patients with features of asthma (see CSA COPD pathway)
#L153
**Other topics to address**
#L154
- Risk factor modification/non-pharmacological measures?
#L155
- Other than avoiding smoke/pollution, this is tricky
#L156
**Interventions to avoid**
#L157
- Do not use oral steroids as a first line therapy for asthma
#L158
  o “It is not acceptable in 2022 to manage asthma with SABAs and oral
#L159
    corticosteroids instead of preventive ICS-containing treatments” – GINA
#L160
- Avoid SABA monotherapy, even in cases of mild asthma
#L161
  o Associated with [increased rates](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/55/4/1901872) of asthma-related death, and urgent asthma-
#L162

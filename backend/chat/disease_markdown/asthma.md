# Disease Name : Asthma

### Symptoms Suggestive of Asthma

Asthma typically presents with a range of respiratory symptoms. Common features include dyspnea, chest tightness, cough, and wheezing. In adults, the presence of more than one type of respiratory symptom increases the likelihood of asthma, as isolated cough alone is rarely indicative of the condition. Symptoms usually vary in intensity and over time. They tend to worsen at night or upon waking and can be triggered by factors such as exercise, laughter, allergens, cold air, or viral infections.

### GINA Guidelines

For comprehensive information on the diagnosis, management, and treatment of asthma, refer to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2023 guidelines. The full report can be accessed at: https://ginasthma.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GINA-2023-Full-report-23_07_06-WMS.pdf

### Spirometry Criteria for Asthma Diagnosis

Spirometry is a key diagnostic tool for asthma. Diagnostic criteria include a forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC) of less than 0.7, along with evidence of reversibility. Reversibility is demonstrated by an improvement in lung function after administration of 2–4 puffs of a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA). A commonly accepted threshold for reversibility is an increase in FEV1 of at least 12 percent and 200 mL.

### Alternative Diagnostic Approach Without Spirometry

In settings where spirometry is not available, asthma can be assessed using pre- and post-bronchodilator peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements. A 20% improvement in peak expiratory flow 15 minutes after administering a bronchodilator is suggestive of asthma. This approach aligns with recommendations from the GINA Guidelines.

### Initial Management After Asthma Diagnosis

If the clinical picture is consistent with asthma, treatment should be initiated. To reconfirm the diagnosis, consider performing spirometry when available. In addition to pharmacological therapy, non-pharmacological management plays a key role. This includes smoking cessation and avoiding known asthma triggers to help reduce symptom frequency and severity.

### Step 1: Initial Pharmacological Treatment for equal to or above 12 yr old

For patients with mild asthma symptoms, Step 1 treatment involves two main options. Track 1 includes the use of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combined with a rapid-onset long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) as needed. Track 2 involves using a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) as needed, with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) taken every time the SABA is used. Both approaches aim to manage symptoms effectively and reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations.

### Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) and Costs in India

Common inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) used in asthma treatment in India include fluticasone, budesonide, and ciclesonide. Fluticasone is available as a metered dose inhaler (Cipla - Flohale, 125 mcg/dose) priced at Rs 267 per inhaler, and as respules (Cipla - Flohale, 0.5 mg) priced at Rs 240.

Fluticasone and salmeterol combinations are available as rotacaps from Macleods Pharma (Flutrol, 50/100 mcg at Rs 155), Zydus Cadila (Forair R cap, 100/50 mcg at Rs 361 for 30 capsules), and Seroflo (500/50 mcg at Rs 472). They are also available as respules from Lupin Labs (Esiflo, 100/50 mcg, 30 capsules at Rs 108), and as metered dose inhalers from Glenmark (Airtec SF, 50/100 mcg at Rs 330) and Sun Pharma (Combitide, 25/125 mcg at Rs 292). Budesonide and formoterol (a rapid-onset LABA) are available as rotacaps from Zydus Cadila (Formonide Resicaps, 200/6 mcg at Rs 147 for a bottle of 30) and as a metered dose inhaler from Kopran Pharma (VentFB inhaler, 100/6 mcg at Rs 134).

### Stepping Down Asthma Treatment

Once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months, treatment should be continued and then gradually stepped down. The goal is to identify the lowest level of treatment that effectively controls both symptoms and exacerbations for the individual patient.

### Step 2: Asthma Treatment Options for equal to or above 12 yr old

Step 2 treatment for asthma includes two options. Track 1 involves using a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combined with a rapid-onset long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) as needed. Track 2 involves taking a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) daily and using a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) as needed.

### Step 3: Asthma Treatment Options for equal to or above 12 yr old

Step 3 treatment includes two tracks. Track 1 involves using a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combined with a rapid-onset long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) for both maintenance and reliever therapy. Track 2 consists of a low-dose ICS combined with a rapid-acting LABA for maintenance, along with a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) as needed.

### Step 4: Asthma Treatment Options for equal to or above 12 yr old

Step 4 treatment includes two tracks. Track 1 involves using a medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combined with a rapid-acting long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) for both maintenance and reliever therapy. Track 2 includes either a medium or high-dose ICS combined with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA), along with a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) as needed or an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus SABA as needed.

### Step 5: Add-On Asthma Treatment Options for equal to or above 12 yr old

Step 5 treatment includes add-on options for patients with uncontrolled asthma. In Track 1, consider adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or using a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combined with a rapid-acting long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). In Track 2, add a LAMA or use a high-dose ICS with a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA).

### Simplified Stepwise Asthma Treatment Approach for patient between 6 to 11 yr old

Step 1: Treat with short-acting beta agonist (SABA) as needed. Step 2: Treat with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) along with SABA as needed. Step 3: Treat with low-dose ICS-long acting beta agonist (LABA) with as needed SABA OR medium-dose ICS with as needed SABA. Step 4: Treat with medium-dose ICS-LABA and refer to a specialist. Step 5: Consider high-dose ICS with rapid-onset LABA (Track 1).

### Dosage Adjustments in Asthma Management

Day-to-day adjustments may involve increasing the use of the reliever inhaler as needed. Short-term adjustments can include increasing the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose for 1–2 weeks, especially in response to triggers such as viral illness, allergen exposure, or pollution.

### Management of Poor Response to Asthma Therapy

If there is a poor response to asthma therapy, first check the patient’s inhaler technique. Confirm or reconsider the diagnosis, assess for risk factors and comorbidities, and consider stepping up the treatment if necessary.

### Clinic Management of Asthma Exacerbations

Asthma management in the clinic begins with assessing clinical stability. For severe cases, look for signs such as the inability to talk in full sentences, respiratory rate over 30 breaths per minute, use of accessory muscles, heart rate over 120 beats per minute, oxygen saturation on room air below 90%, and a peak flow less than 50% of predicted. These patients require immediate transfer to a higher center of care. While awaiting transfer, provide short-acting beta agonists (SABA), ipratropium bromide, oxygen, and systemic corticosteroids.

In mild to moderate cases, the patient may talk in phrases, prefer sitting, show no signs of agitation, have a slightly elevated respiratory rate, a heart rate between 100–120 bpm, oxygen saturation between 90–95%, and a peak flow above 50%. These patients can be treated at the clinic. Administer salbutamol (4–10 puffs via spacer) every 20 minutes for one hour, and give prednisolone—40–50 mg for adults, or 1–2 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg) for children. If available, start oxygen therapy with a target SpO2 of 93–95% in adults and 94–98% in children.

Reassess the patient after one hour. If the condition worsens, transfer is needed. If symptoms improve—indicated by reduced symptoms, no need for SABA, peak flow 60–80% of predicted or personal best, and SpO2 over 94%—the patient can be discharged safely. Ensure a safe discharge destination and provide a home action plan. Prednisolone should be continued for 5–7 days in adults and 3–5 days in children. Follow-up should occur within 2–7 days for adults and 1–2 days for children. Continue the rescue inhaler as needed; options include SABA, low-dose ICS-LABA, or ICS-SABA. Maintenance therapy with ICS-LABA should also be continued or up-titrated.

### Home Therapy of Asthma Exacerbations

All patients with asthma should have a personalized asthma action plan. Home therapy for exacerbations depends on the current treatment step (Step 1 or Step 2).

During an acute exacerbation, increase the use of the reliever inhaler. If the regular reliever is an ICS-LABA combination, increase the frequency without exceeding the maximum daily dosage. If the reliever is a short-acting beta agonist (SABA), increase the frequency as needed.

To prevent future exacerbations, the preventer inhaler should also be adjusted. If the usual preventer is ICS-formoterol, continue using it for maintenance and increase the ICS-formoterol reliever as required. If the preventer is ICS with SABA as reliever, quadruple the dose of ICS. These changes should be continued for 1–2 weeks.

If the patient’s peak flow is less than 60% of their previous best or if there is no improvement after 48 hours, continue both the reliever and preventer therapies. Additionally, start oral prednisone 40–50 mg and contact a doctor for further evaluation.

### Asthma-COPD Overlap

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both obstructive airway conditions that can share overlapping features. Some patients, especially those with long-standing asthma and risk factors for COPD such as smoking, may exhibit characteristics of both diseases.

In cases where features of both asthma and COPD are present, the treatment approach should prioritize asthma management. This means initiating therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), as they are essential in managing asthma symptoms and reducing inflammation.

Importantly, first-line COPD treatments—such as long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) or long-acting beta agonists (LABA) without ICS—are not suitable as initial therapy for patients who show features of asthma. Proper assessment and tailored treatment are critical in managing this overlap effectively.

### Risk Factor Modification and Non-Pharmacological Measures in Asthma

Risk factor modification is an important but sometimes challenging aspect of asthma management. Avoidance of smoking and exposure to air pollution remains the most effective and widely applicable intervention. Patients should be counseled on the importance of smoke-free environments and minimizing exposure to pollutants and allergens whenever possible.

Beyond this, non-pharmacological measures can be less straightforward. While allergen avoidance and lifestyle adjustments like maintaining a healthy weight and managing stress may help, their effectiveness can vary significantly between individuals. Regular follow-up and personalized education remain key components in helping patients understand and manage their unique risk factors.

### Differential Diagnosis of Cough

When evaluating a patient with cough, it is essential to consider a broad range of differential diagnoses beyond asthma. Common conditions that can present with chronic or persistent cough include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and pneumonia. Rhinitis or rhinosinusitis may lead to postnasal drip, contributing to chronic cough.

Other potential causes include post-viral tussive syndrome, eosinophilic bronchitis, and cough induced by medications such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Additionally, infection with Bordetella pertussis should be considered, particularly if there is a history of prolonged paroxysmal coughing episodes. Accurate diagnosis requires careful clinical evaluation and may involve spirometry, imaging, and a review of medication history.

### Vaccinations in Asthma

Patients with asthma should receive vaccinations for influenza, pneumococcal disease, and COVID-19.

### Interventions to Avoid in Asthma Management

Oral steroids should not be used as a first-line therapy for asthma. According to GINA, it is not acceptable to manage asthma with SABAs and oral corticosteroids instead of preventive ICS-containing treatments. SABA monotherapy should be avoided, even in mild asthma, as it is linked to increased rates of asthma-related death and urgent healthcare visits. Asthma exacerbations should not be treated with corticosteroid therapy, and methylxanthines, such as theophylline, should not be used for asthma treatment.

### Stepwise Asthma Management (12+) per GINA Guidelines

The image details the GINA 2023 guidelines for personalized asthma management in patients aged 12 and above. It emphasizes a continuous cycle of assessment, adjustment, and review to achieve optimal symptom control and minimize future risks, underscoring the necessity of tailoring treatment to each individual's specific needs. This process involves evaluating symptoms, exacerbations, lung function, comorbidities, and patient satisfaction to inform treatment strategies, which include managing modifiable risk factors, employing non-pharmacological methods, adjusting medications, and providing patient education and skills training.

The guidelines offer two primary pathways for controller and reliever therapy. Track 1, the preferred strategy, uses ICS-formoterol for both control and quick relief, which is highlighted for its effectiveness in reducing exacerbations and its simplicity compared to using a separate SABA reliever. This track progresses through five steps, starting with as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol and escalating to higher maintenance doses, the addition of LAMA, and consideration of biologic treatments for severe asthma phenotypes. Track 2 presents an alternative, beginning with taking ICS whenever SABA is needed, then moving to low-dose maintenance ICS and ICS-LABA combinations, with similar later steps involving LAMA and biologics.

In addition to these main tracks, the guidelines suggest other controller options for specific situations. These include low to medium dose ICS with as-needed SABA or daily LTRA or HOM SLIT, the addition of LAMA or switching to high-dose ICS, and considering azithromycin or LTRA at higher levels, while being cautious of potential side effects. The image also refers to the GINA severe asthma guide for more detailed information on managing severe asthma cases.
